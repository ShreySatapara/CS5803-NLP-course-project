appeal by the appellants by special leave:
Held, that to establish a charge of criminal breach of
trust, the prosecution was not bound to prove the precise
mode of conversion, misappropriation or misapplication by
the accused of the property entrusted to him or over which

he had dominion.[SEP]The principal ingredient of the offence of
criminal breach of trust being dishonest misappropriation
the mere failure of the accused to account for the property
entrusted to him might not be the foundation of his
conviction in all cases but where he was unable to account
and rendered an explanation for his failure which was
untrue, an inference of misappropriation with dishonest
intent might readily be made.[SEP]The essence of liability under S. 34 of the Indian Penal
Code is the existence of a common intention animating the
offenders and the participation in a criminal act in
furtherance of the common intention.[SEP]The physical presence
at the scene of offence of the offender sought to be
rendered liable under S. 34 is not, on the words of the
statute, one of the conditions of its applicability in every
case.",PREAMBLE
