2ac501ef47eb47e2806dc6cb117aec33,2164,2194, The relevant facts are these ,FAC
b77b3029acd64a74add6900026211088,2195,2339,Messrs Chunilal Moonga Ram a firm of Delhi carried on a speculative business in bullion mostly in old and silver in Chandni Chowk at Delhi ,FAC
ec0789d16add4261b836dc1788924d09,2340,2467,For the assessment year 1946 47 it was charged to income tax on its income from the business in the relevant accounting period ,FAC
4fa5b593e2de4c04a27bb2011547c6c6,2468,2580,Similarly it was charged to excess profits tax for the chargeable accounting period ending on February 6 1946 ,FAC
3cbb3bd78f5b4b37bba8a2470dffa484,2580,2776, One of the appeals Civil Appeal No 39 of 1960 arises out of the assessment of income tax and the other appeal Civil Appeal No 40 of 1960 arises out of the assessment of excess profits tax ,FAC
f1b77a6c45e7417d819131e50ce81a8a,2777,3016,During the relevant accounting periods the firm entered into certain transactions called hedge transactions in the billion market at Bhatinda then a part of the Patiala State that is outside the taxable territories of British India ,FAC
68dc79ff912144e280ffa6631a11c8e8,3017,3240,It claimed that it had incurred losses to non residents there in the sums of Rs 6 366 and Rs 16 615 in the said transactions and claimed that these losses should be taken into consideration in determining its income ,FAC
10ebe3c022aa40c6a7bc62b95b86ccb0,3241,3500,It appears from the assessment order of the Income tax Officer Delhi dated January 27 1949 that the firm purchased certain sillies bars of gold and silver from a Bhatinda party on the telephone which purchases were later confirmed by a letter or wire ,FAC
eda3a87d1c99491297a03ada3a275768,3500,3590, Similarly the bars were also sold by the firm through a Bhatinda party on the telephone ,FAC
0b961c0f24e54ff79b23a9048cb7e1b5,3591,3737,Apparently no delivery was intended to be taken or was taken of the bars bought or sold nor did the firm have any branch or agent at Bhatinda ,FAC
56a358c9fa3a42d4a52c60d659cf1a74,3738,3887,The transactions were in the nature of forward transactions carried out by means of telephonemessages letters or telegrams with parties at Bhatinda ,FAC
7723646a1b134775bb5e6fddc84105c2,3887,3994, This was the nature of the transactions Which resulted in the losses for which the firm claimed deduction ,FAC
0b2d5e7e339948d7877f4973772c9b99,3995,4240,The Income tax authorities disallowed the claim on the ground that if the Bhatinda transactions had resulted in profits such profits would have been exempt from tax in terms of s 14 2 c as it then stood and if the profits were exempt from tax,FAC
ea9d3e2c5d664ca4a3f48008d63d714c,4240,4319, the proviso to a 24 1 of the Act was a bar to the adjustment of the losses ,FAC
ea27569c65bc4041b083c70cb1e525b6,4320,4378,The assessee then moved the Income tax Appellate Tribunal ,FAC
52e9ac9343d340e1aff1509b74eb26f9,4379,4487,The Appellate Tribunal however allowed the deduction claimed on grounds which are not very clearly stated ,FAC
d1ff5abc597545d6a6bb8c76355a3104,4488,4899,It appears that the Tribunal proceeded on the footing that it was not possible to split up transactions of a business located in the taxable territories into two categories of transactions inside and outside such territories and even if such spliting up was possible the Bhatinda transactions would fall within s 42 of the Act and the income etc therefrom would be deemed to have arisen in British India ,FAC
4e7d24f27590411f94254c751f089a4f,4900,5305,In this view of the matter the Accountant Member of the Tribunal who delivered the judgment of the Tribunal said To start with it seems to us that there is no warrant either in terms of s 14 2 c or in terms of the proviso to s 24 1 to split up the transactions of a business located in the taxable territories into transactions in taxable territories and transactions without taxable territories ,FAC
0f5dc072f8d84866b2ac6770207424df,5306,5574,Even if that treatment were permitted and the profits or losses resulting from transactions outside the taxable territories can be described as income profits and gains such income profits and gains are deemed under s 42 to have accrued or arisen in British India ,FAC
10b6941a418a4453bde347fac0b52038,5575,5691,The results of transactions of the nature under review are therefore not exempt from tax by virtue of s 14 2 c ,FAC
c25dd3b55fff4b91adf82068f0d930c7,5692,5773,The proviso to s 214 1 does riot in any case come into play ,FAC
f35771f206534c0da5e073eec23385c9,5774,5957,The Income tax authorities have in this view that we have taken wrongly disallowed the assessee s claim for adjustment of losses amounting to Rs 6 360 and Rs 16 615 ,FAC
9fe243dd350946c3b14dadeaea523136,5958,5981,We allow these losses ,FAC
ef6166200fed49708da835bf5bb8877a,5981,6031, The Tribunal accordingly allowed the two appeals ,FAC
940882c027d34d91b71c69d1c3644285,6032,6188,We may here state that the Income tax authorities as also the Tribunal considered the claim for deduction in relation to the assessment for income tax only ,FAC
29203a7d0b9a418f95119297d905ebcd,6189,6401,As to the excess profits tax there was no separate discussion of the provisions of S 5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act 1940 and they dealt with the assessment of excess profits tax as a mere consequential matter ,FAC
ada90bea87ae4c3d83b36603b727bbdd,6401,6577, The Commissioner of Income tax Delhi then made two applications asking the Tribunal to refer certain questions of law arising out of its orders to the High Court of Punjab ,FAC
17e012338fee4665880cf30f912b1b28,6578,6692,The Tribunal cam to the conclusion that no questions of law arose out of its orders and rejected the applications ,FAC
b4606e44990c4477989a5216ec03c506,6693,7300,The High Court was then moved under s 66 2 of the Indian income tax Act 1922 and the High Court heard the two applications together and directed the Tribunal to state a case on the following two questions which in the opinion of the High Court arose out of the Tribunal s orders 1 Whether the claim of loss in this case is governed by the provisions of S 10 1 or 24 1 proviso read with s 14 2 c or by the provisions of s 42 2 Whether on the facts of the case a loss of Rs 22 981 is allowable in computing the income of the assessee chargeable to the Excess Profits Tax ,RLC
b5cb9b7d572443fe83a028a9787f736e,7300,7379, The Tribunal then drew up a statement of case on the two questions aforesaid ,RLC
7d66ff795e1a423d83f13977cb780cdf,7380,7498,By its judgement and order dated January 23 1957 the High Court answered both the questions in favour of theassessee ,RLC
9f97964211fa43ffa08b5b6442f284f2,7499,7705,Thereafter the Commissioner of Incometax Delhi asked for and obtained a certificate under s 66A 2 of the Indian Income tax Act and on that certificate the present appeals have been brought to this Court ,FAC
0cdeb68ca7c54256ad2d9bdba13d9143,7705,8003, As to the first question the learned Additional Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the appellant has conceded that him not in a position to dispute the correctness of the answer given in view of the decision of this Court in Commissioner of Income tax v Indo Mercantile Bank Ltd 1 ,ARG_PETITIONER
917eb39a435b4460bd1dc34c0ca2c0e8,8003,8073, This disposes of Civil Appeal No 39 of 1960 which must be dismissed ,ARG_PETITIONER
97c802ddf41b4dfc8784408d7e49f289,8073,8144, In Civil Appeal No 40 of 1960 the second question falls for decision ,ANALYSIS
1e464379acaf4ea78279e7327a0adcc4,8145,9623,In answering this second question the High Court has proceeded on two grounds firstly it has referred to s 5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act 1940 particularly the third proviss thereto and contracting the provisions of that section with s 5 of the Business Profits Tax Act of 1947 has expressed the view that neither of these provisions touched the question whether losses incurred in an Indian State could be taken into account in assessing the taxable income of an assessee in British India for purposes of assessing excess profits tax or business profits tax it then referred to the decision of the Bombay High Court in Karamchand Premchand Ltd v Commissioner of Income tax Bombay 2 and said It would seem that inspite of the slightly different language of the Excess Profits Tax Act from that of the Income tax Act no distinction has ever been drawn in this matter between the principles governing assessment to income tax and the principles governing assessment to excess profits tax and in fact it would appear to have been the universal 1 1959 36 I T R 1 2 1956 30I T R 849 practice that decisions of the Income tax authorities and High Courts have been followed by consequential orders relating to the same assessee s taxable income for the purpose of the Excess Profits Tax Act and the learned counsel for the Commissioner has not been able to cite any decision in which different principles have been applied in this particular matter ,ANALYSIS
6167c81f6e7e4dafa6aeca55f61dc964,9624,10138,Admittedly one of the reasons given in his judgment by Chagla C J for coming to the decision mentioned above was that the third proviso had been changed in the Business Profits Tax Act as compared with the Excess Profit Tax Act but this is only one of a number of reasons and the questions has not been considered at all whether under the proviso in the Excess Profits Tax Act losses made in an Indian State could have been computed in assessing the assessee s income from business in British India ,ANALYSIS
55db0ecda85b4c99a5ece1141943025c,10139,10565,I can only say that in the circumstances it seems to me likely that if the point had arisen the same view that I have expressed above would have been taken namely that whereas for the excess profits tax profits earned in an Indian State could not be taken into consideration at all such profits could be taken into account if brought into taxable territories for assessing profits tax and that is regards losses ,ANALYSIS
b89d1b409fe144479559b28fcc51aa6a,10566,10691,they I could be taken into account in assessing the business whether they occurred in a State or in what was British India ,ANALYSIS
770cb526daec403687642c6508a373ab,10691,10762, The second ground given by the High Court depended on the facts found ,ANALYSIS
6fe7dafd1b4543db9426cd6370575a32,10763,10909,The High Court expressed the view that on the facts found it was doubtful if the losses in question could be deemed to have occurred in Bhatinda ,ANALYSIS
6c06430ed851495aace25e4ed8613b43,10909,11116, It said It is not in dispute that the only place where the assessee carries on business is Delhi and that its transactions in other markets are carried out by means of commu nication by telephone or Post ,ANALYSIS
be05298d41e74cbe9d1c8ddaa8c7972c,11117,11524,There is no Suggestion that the firm has any agent or branch in any native State and it therefore seems to me that whether profits result or losses are incurred as the result of transac tions of this kind even with firms in Indian States the profits accrue or the losses are incurred at the place where the payments are received or from which they are made namely the firm s place of business at Delhi ,ANALYSIS
87cb7cd07c6e47f1a36b626afb33ea96,11524,11694, On behalf of the appellant it is contended that both the aforesaid grounds given by the High Court for the answer which it gave to the second question are unsubstantial ,ANALYSIS
daca078cbf534b93a62bc7e2f5d2c35d,11694,11767, The first ground it is contended is untenable in law and the second ,ANALYSIS
e2ae3103f7ff403498989889add32d9d,11768,11928,proceeds not on the findings of fact arrived at by the Tribunal but on new findings made by the High Court which course was not open to the High Court to take ,ANALYSIS
66971e66b1c34d00bf040ecbd6a728ea,11928,11976, We consider that these contentions are correct ,ANALYSIS
fc2f57f0413748139ffa24ca954e2304,11977,12286,As to the first ground it seems clear to us that under the third proviso to s 5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act 1940 where the profits etc of a part of the firm s business accrued or arose it Bhatinda that part of the business shall for the purpose of the said section be deemed to be a separate business ,ANALYSIS
9beaf6ce11d34e9795a571e6db21589d,12287,12383,If that is so the losses which arose at Bhatinda must also be the losses of a separate business ,ANALYSIS
7b8e3e373a6a49709f1c9ecd0ffaa1e4,12384,12450,We may here read s 5 and the third proviso thereto lm15 s 5 ,STA
95eff563e6814558a88acb8313d5bffc,12451,13269,This act shall apply to every business of which any part of the profits made during the chargeable accounting period is chargeable to income tax by virtue of the provisions of sub clause i on sub clause ii of clause b of subsection 1 of section 4 of theIndian Income tax Act 1922 or of clause c of that sub section Provided further that this act shall not apply to any business the whole of the profits of which accrue or arise in an Indian State and where the profits of a part of a business accrue or arise in an Indian State such part shall for the purposes of this provision be deemed to be a separate business the hole of the profits of which accrue or arise in an Indian State and the other part of the busi ness shall for all the purposes of this Act be deemed to be a separate business ,STA
2bae63b525714ed18d9babfe20dbb999,13270,13332,In Commissioner of Income tax v Karamchand Premchand Ltd 1 ,PRE_RELIED
2d29d0dee6404fd6bb661b27152981b1,13333,13532,This Court considered s 5 of the Business Profits Tax Act 1947 and pointed out the distinction between the third proviso thereto and the third proviso to s 5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act 1 940 ,PRE_RELIED
ca65ae057faf4eb1808ad2f1bfdfaf41,13533,13884,This Court quoted with approval the decision in Commissioner of Excess Profits Tax Bombay City v Bhogilal H Patel Bombay 2 and held that the language used in the third proviso to S 5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act 1940 was one of exclusion and that Act did not apply to profits etc of that part of the business which arose in an Indian State ,PRE_RELIED
b0f440eb572a4862bcceb7c4f582cd5a,13885,14123,If that part of the business has to be treated as a separate business for the purposes of the Excess Profits Tax Act it is difficult to see how the losses incurred in an Indian State can be taken into consideration for the same purposes ,ANALYSIS
3470780c878d46e3bef349c41112e4f2,14124,14301,We think that the High Court was in error in thinking that the third proviso to s 5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act did not touch the question which the High Court had to answer ,ANALYSIS
0d4de7a035474b829ffe1972812635c5,14302,14437,On the 2 1952 21 I T R 72 1 1960 40 I T R 106 contrary we think that the proviso answers the question against the assessee ,ANALYSIS
84224b9b672244348144b565479bccf2,14438,14491,Now as to the second ground given by the High Court ,ANALYSIS
c3b44202e6eb4501a5213ba56a385199,14492,14742,It seems to us that there can be no doubt that the assessing authorities proceeded on the footing that the losses for which the assessee firm claimed a deduction arose and were incurred at Bhatinda even though the firm s place of business was Delhi ,ANALYSIS
965891a72a4d4da2bc2f2186122c688c,14743,14957,The Income tax Officer as also the Appellate Assistant Commissioner referred to s 14 2 c of the Income tax Act 1922 that provision related to income profit or gains accruing or arising in an Indian State ,ANALYSIS
c35d2287fef14f629142c8c7f36858f8,14957,15165, The assessing authorities proceeded on the footing that as the proof its we are exempt from tax in terms of s 14 2 c the losses arising out side the taxable territories could not be taken into account ,ANALYSIS
9bc573dca5e04cb19a3c3fec0d2d875d,15166,15268,The Tribunal did not rely on s 14 2 c nor on the proviso to s 24 1 of the Income tax Act 1922 ,ANALYSIS
6cc6c422275d45858d513138c09c53f1,15269,15291,But it relied on s 42 ,ANALYSIS
470d2b5b9135486cba8e5c0c78eed041,15292,15544,That again shows that it proceeded on the footing that though the income actually arose outside the taxable territories it should be deemed to have arisen with in the taxable territories by reason of its business connection in the taxable territories ,ANALYSIS
ca4543f3bf534f079c1e50670b7be95e,15545,15661,The High Court had to answer the second question on the facts found it could not arrived at fresh findings of fact ,ANALYSIS
7ff6c0efde7649a49ec31dd5c7548194,15662,15695,Such a course was not open to it ,ANALYSIS
54debedf3a3b4b3aa210a8ce7ff341f0,15695,15858, Indeed it is true that the Tribunal said that the firm s transactions could not be split up but the actual decision of the tribunal proceeded on the basis that ,ANALYSIS
07daa08e0d3d4fc9ad9bebe940f20c47,15859,16096,even it the transactions could be split up s 42 applied and the income actually arising at Bhatinda would be deemed to have arisen in the taxable territories and so the losses must be taken into consideration for arriving at the income ,ANALYSIS
637902f869594e22a9b2092843003211,16097,16194,The Tribunal considered the matter solely from the point of view of the assessment of income tax ,ANALYSIS
a57db4c3e3014b9280ea2c5d6dff2746,16195,16355,It did not consider the third proviso to s 5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act 1940 and what effect it had in the matter of the assessment of excess profits tax ,ANALYSIS
063d0bd82e31469cb9b71e40e29ee8b9,16356,16499,We agree that if the incomedid not arise or accrue in Bhatinda but the whole of it arose in Delhi the third proviso would have no application ,ANALYSIS
e700760629e04aa091f5165b00e941d8,16499,16728, If however part of the income etc arose in Bhatinda there that part of the business was a separate business for the purposes of the Excess Profits Tax Act and the losses incurred at Bhatinda could not be taken into account ,ANALYSIS
2ee65449d8204b27840528bce4c23a88,16729,16867,We are of the view that on the facts found the answer to the second question must be in favour of the appellant and against the assessee ,RPC

3f2d2e4a508c4959b4b5902787f859b4,5193,5359,The High Court felt that the trial court had missed the essence of the offences with which the appellants had been charged and therefore there was failure of justice ,RLC
94e5f8a763884a91b537dd68aebfff15,5360,5561,Hence it set aside the judgment of acquittal passed by the Magistrate and remanded the case for retrial for offences punishable under section 341 read with section 34 or section 149 Indian Penal Code ,RLC
1eb03e1f210543478b3f984ddfd3bf04,5562,5645,Aggrieved by the judgment of the High Court the appellants have filed this appeal ,FAC
eb058f7afa024c3db00914564dc3c72a,5647,6015,After going through the judgment of the Magistrate and of the High Court we feel that whatever might have been the error committed by the Magistrate in the circumstances of the case it was not just and proper for the High Court to have remanded the case for fresh trial when the order of acquittal had been passed nearly six years before the judgment of High Court ,ANALYSIS
3bd3d42e718944b29229151688344f44,6016,6133,The pendency of the Criminal Appeal for six years before the High Court is itself a regrettable feature of this case ,ANALYSIS
3322eb3546b54815bafa45a6b303543f,6134,6233,In addition to it the order directing retrial has resulted in serious prejudice to the appellants ,ANALYSIS
0b255102a8d34e9d8579d046d6dcee38,6233,6635, We are of the view that having regard to the nature of the acts alleged to have been committed by the appellants and other attendant circumstances this was a case in which the High Court should have directed the dropping of the proceedings in exercise of its inherent powers under section 482 Criminal Procedure Code even if for some reason on it came to the conclusion that the acquittal was wrong ,ANALYSIS
62999eae71fb486d89670d2712d28da0,6636,6759,A fresh trial nearly seven years after the alleged incident is bound to result in harassment and abuse of judicial process ,ANALYSIS
b2fc0c9683b041dc8ddf894175112c51,6760,6897,We may at this state refer to the decision of this Court in S Veerabadran Chettiar v E V Ramswami Nacker Ors 1959 S C R 1211 ,PRE_RELIED
8513eed842924d46a4e2bdf5137d2c02,6898,7386,In that case this Court disagreed with the High Court on the interpretation of section 295 of the Indian Penal Code and the order of dismissal of complaint by the Courts below but it proceeded to observe at page 1218 thus But the question still remains whether even after expressing our strong disagreement with the interpretation of the section by the courts below this Court should direct a further inquiry into the complaint which has stood dismissed for the last about 5 years ,PRE_RELIED
75d174d8a69647bca4d616676b1f2a81,7387,7568,The action complained of against the accused persons if true was foolish to put if mildly but as the case has become stale we do not direct further inquiry into this complaint ,PRE_RELIED
4819490f6b164f128ed0a30e28406f38,7569,7816,If there is a recurrence of such a foolish behaviour on the part of any section of the community we have no doubt that those charged with the duty of maintaining law and order will apply the law in the sense in which we have interpreted the law ,PRE_RELIED
fcb1e4698ae34eb4804a37a6099fc0e8,7817,7853,The appeal is therefore dismissed ,PRE_RELIED
b604b72419dc4918986aad58ca4448e5,7853,8469, We are of the view that following the above principle the High Court should have dismissed the appeal before it even if it disagreed with the view taken by the trial court with regard to the gist of the offence punishable under section 341 Indian Penal Code having regard to the inordinate delay of nearly six years that had ensued after the judgment of acquittal the nature and magnitude of the offences alleged to have been committed by the appellants and the difficulties that may have to be encountered in securing the presence of witnesses in a case of this nature nearly 7 years after the incident ,RATIO
9ab7a9f5e1ab400e91e173632fb5fccf,8470,8745,The termination of the criminal proceedings in that way would secure the ends of justice as it would bring about reconciliation between the management and the employees and also put an end to a stale criminal proceedings in which the public had no longer sufficient interest ,RATIO
5d31f4a350fd41dd9a3defe1d8c376c6,8746,8979,We accordingly set aside the judgment of the High Court and restore the order of acquittal passed in this case by the Metropolitan Magistrate without however expressing any opinion on the issues of facts and law involved in the case ,RPC

463db75acdd445fca68cbbf9c8dec50b,5490,5582,It is the case of the assessee that he continued the said business as the Kartha of the HUF ,ANALYSIS
3d26e2588da3434c80fa653097b11ecc,5583,5849,The reason given by the Lower Authorities to come to the conclusion that the amount is to be assessed in the hands of the assessee as an individual instead of HUF is that the HUF did not have money to invest in this business as they have not maintained any accounts ,ANALYSIS
1188e29070b640efa2c2db70a24ef773,5850,5923,The said inference drawn by the assessing authority is without any basis ,ANALYSIS

a2def876bf0b4c539bfae75bcdc9d5e1,6379,6506,It is because books were not maintained and returns were not filed the authorities laid their hands on the undisclosed income ,ANALYSIS
11b52f8eb4844816bad0c0999a9ca9c9,6507,6739,Therefore the Tribunal was justified in the facts of the case in holding that the said amount is to be assessed in the hands of the HUF in the aforesaid circumstances and not in the hands of the assessee in his individual capacity ,ANALYSIS
47ef3bafbd724cdb8b57a359085ec596,6740,6999,In fact during such proceedings the assessee had requested the authorities to adjust this undisclosed income and seized cash as advance tax for HUF and therefore we do not find any infirmity in the order passed by the Tribunal which calls for interference ,ANALYSIS

425d1e32984c4a9c8b1ef110d175f1ae,6850,7562,The relevant portion of s 3 of the Madras Act on which the learned counsel for the appellant relies provides 3 1 Every dealer other than a casual trader or agent of a non resident dealer whose total turnover for a year is not less than ten thousand rupees and every casual trader or agent of a non resident dealer whatever be his turnover for the year shall pay a tax for each year at the rate of two per cent of his taxable turnover I Section 2 p defines taxable turnover to mean the turnover on which a dealer shall be liable to pay tax as determined after making such deductions from his total turnover and in such manner as may be prescribed and year is defined to mean financial year ,STA

deb4d903c61147ef95d75046cc01b821,13471,13922,The Learned Counsel for the appellant relies upon the decision in Madhusudan Das Vs Narayani Bai Ors reported in AIR 1983 SC 114 wherein it is held that In an appeal against a Trial Court decree when the appellate court considers an issue turning on oral evidence it must bear in mind that it does not enjoy the advantage which the trial court had in having the witnesses before it and of observing the manner in which they gave their testimony ,ARG_PETITIONER
e64a7b9c1b38454186ff4a3dedf9d803,13923,14418,When there is a conflict of oral evidence on any matter in issue and its resolution turns upon the credibility of the witnesses the general rule is that the appellate court should permit the findings of fact rendered by the trial court to prevail unless it clearly appears that some special feature about the evidence of a particular witness has escaped the notice of the trial court or there is a sufficient balance of improbability to displace its opinion as to where the credibility lies ,ARG_PETITIONER

c52239203ab440059f9617507ab0bf96,15847,16070,This submission even if accepted would not exonerate the accused because the willingness after the matter had been reported to the higher authorities could not efface or undo the offence earlier committed by the accused ,ANALYSIS
424a73cd3f4a44898c511f51b1d8bad7,16070,16218, Argument has then been advanced on behalf of the appellants that Sub Inspector Patil did not make investigation in the case in accordance with law ,ANALYSIS
7d773297a81e428fb0be7b18c0d8ccac,16219,16498,It is urged that permission to make investigation was granted to Sub Inspector Patil on November 12 1966 and as such he was not authorized to make before that date the enquiry which led to the registration of the case as that enquiry partook of the character of investigation ,ANALYSIS
01f58e025bf04b45bc15fe90d8d9ff40,16499,16625,Nothing has been brought to our notice as to how an enquiry before the registration of a case can be held to be investigation ,ANALYSIS
58005cfaa686410b8f62de4ca35a7ee6,16626,16948,The matter however need not be dilated upon and it is not necessary to express any final opinion in the matter because we find that there is no material on the record as may show that the accused were prejudiced because of the alleged non compliance with the provisions of section 5A of the Prevention of Corruption Act ,ANALYSIS
f583965a41bd4262875ea7e9a7ab9367,16949,17317,It is well established that where cxognizance of a case has in fact been taken by the court on a police report following investigationconducted in breach of provisions of section 5A of the Prevention of Corruption Act the result of the trial cannot be set aside unless the illegality in the investigation can be shown to have brought about a miscarriage of justice ,ANALYSIS
d9aca8d64a594753b132d90264b2c3d2,17318,17504,The underlying reason for the above dictum is that an illegality committed in the course of investigation does not affect the competence and jurisdiction of the court to try the accused ,ANALYSIS
a116367befd34e33be9c08f2a9e17f39,17505,17835,Where therefore the trial of the case has proceeded to termination the invalidity of the proceeding investigation would not vitiate the conviction of the accused as a result of the trial unless the illegality in the investigation has caused prejudice to the accused see H N Rishbud and Inder Singh v The State of DelHi 1 ,PRE_RELIED
fb3053f9ea714584bdc88718e658c6b0,17836,18033,Since there has been no miscarriage of justice in the present case because of the alleged non compliance with section 5A the conviction of the accused appellants cannot be set aside on that score ,ANALYSIS
e495ff9e0a6c4b3a8f8c66c295903e3e,18033,18363, For the same reason we are unable to accede to the contention of Mr Kotwal that the conviction of the accused should be set aside because permission under section 5A of the Prevention of Corruption Act to SI Patil for investigation of the offence was granted in a casual manner and without the existence of sufficient reasons ,ANALYSIS
0d574d4b319f445cb468d82a35ff1075,18363,18528, Lastly it has been argued by Mr Kotwal that the prosecution of the accused was barred by time under section 23 of the Bombay Land Improvement Schemes Act 1942 ,ANALYSIS
88a64871523c4ce293c009be73765d11,18529,19227,The section reads as under 1 No suit prosecution or other legal proceeding shall be instituted against any public servant or person duly authorized under this Act in respect of anything in good faith done or intended to be done under this Act or the rules made thereunder 2 No suit or prosecution shall be instituted against any public servant or person duly authorized under this Act in respect of anything done or intended to be done under this Act unless the suit or prosecution has been instituted within six months from the date of the act complained of Sub section 1 of the section has plainly no application as it relates to anything done in good faith ,STA
858c9a6dca6f466eba54486f040ef4ab,19228,19391,According to Bombay General Clauses Act a thing shall be deemed to be done in good faith where it is in fact done honestly whether it is done negligently or not ,ANALYSIS
7030de98f32948a1910fd07b431131b2,19392,19550,The appellants admittedly were not acting honestly when they prepared the false documents in question and showed disbursement of Rs 369 07 on March 11 1966 ,ANALYSIS
a401dd9666d34bbe9600a340efb63aa9,19551,19758,Mr Kotwal however relies on sub section 2 of section 23 and 1 1955 1 S C R 1150 submits that the prosecution could be instituted against the appellants only within six months from March 11 1966 ,ANALYSIS
c8de5202c2c74457b9f2f355c8a85fb0,19759,19916,As the charge sheet was submitted long after the expire of six months the case against the accused appellants according to the counsel was barred by time ,ANALYSIS
9b2465ccd80944c6aa94903976cb1f94,19917,19969,This contention in our opinion is devoid of force ,ANALYSIS
cd925849f95d4320ac681db82cce7cb3,19970,20178,Sub section 2 refers to suit or prosecution against a public servant or person duly authorized under the Act in respect of anything done or intended to be done under the Bombay Land Improvement Schemes Act ,ANALYSIS
568de6e716cf46b38f606a7b660cc8f2,20179,20445,It cannot be said that the acts of the accused appellants in preparing false documents and in committing criminal breach of trust in respect of the amount of Rs 369 07 as also their act of criminal misconduct were done under the Bombay Land Improvement Schemes Act ,ANALYSIS
eef7d35e40c744a5817d87882196e55d,20446,20617,Sub section 2 of section 23 deals with anything done or intended to be done under the above mentioned Act by a public servant or a person duly authorized under the Act ,ANALYSIS
72eff8e2f82c4300afb7e67c69eff530,20617,20833, It has no application where something is done not under the Act even though it has been done by a public servant who has been entrusted with duties of carrying out improvement schemes under the above mentioned Act ,ANALYSIS
21e93bca92db420db48dccc7eb649a81,20834,21019,The impugned acts of the appellants in the present case were not in discharge of their duties under the above mentioned Act but in obvious breach and flagrant disregard of their duties ,RATIO
1ff44894b0ed462b8191ad6604d4e5c6,21020,21221,Not only they did no rectification work for the Bundh which was a part of the improvement scheme they also misappropriated the amount which had been entrusted to them for the purpose of rectification ,RATIO

4e735c46341d43068f4eb07c87eca3fd,3283,3440,We are of the considered view that for the purpose of deciding this appeal we can even presume that there was some verbal altercation between the two sides ,ANALYSIS

296e8b3d49f04415923075a5ef24704d,3475,3612,The main defence is that there was a free fight on both sides and that there is no evidence to show that there is prior meeting of minds ,ANALYSIS
305528ea96b14ff4a98e24ad94768675,3613,3791,The accused had not been convicted under Section 34 or Section 149 IPC and therefore each individual accused can only be convicted for the injury attributed to that individual ,ANALYSIS

f086db258b2c428fa62931c79124e59a,5386,5579,The first injury is a lacerated wound and it is urged by Mr S Nagamuthu learned senior counsel that this injury could not have been caused by sickle Koduval which is a sharpedged weapon ,FAC

111be711ccad4a1c9f4f020bb1f6ee04,6203,6556,It has been urged that the case would fall within Exception 4 to Section 300 IPC which reads as follows Exception 4 Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner 7 ,STA

bf572fb576cd4307aaa7c9075033db34,7166,7779,Even otherwise we feel that Exception 4 is not applicable because the manner in which the blow was given right on the middle of the head brings this case squarely within clause Fourthly of Section 300 IPC which reads as follows 300 Murder xxx xxx xxx Secondly xxx xxx xxx Thirdly xxx xxx xxx Fourthly If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death and commits such act without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid ,STA

b34206cbd0ca47a5ae6634cdec71cb54,8208,8375,These facts were not known to the High Court when it made its order of enhancement but it is a matter relevant for our consideration now that the appeal is before us ,ANALYSIS
ebeeb54d1b754e408998dc90dff079d1,8375,8494, Now the High Court accept the findings of the Sessions Judge about the circumstances in which the offence took place ,ANALYSIS
81a310723c9e40689f14a793c42a4888,8494,8637, They agree that the attack was not premeditated and that there was a sudden quarrel and that the blows were inflicted in the heat of passion ,ANALYSIS
48f839cf53e142d7a43685c017234aaa,8638,8734,They also say that there was counter abuse and they notice the abrasion on the appellant s nose ,ANALYSIS
2011e8e1bffb4e9fbbb16754005ca4cc,8735,8901,Despite this they hold that it is possible that this injury was received by the appellant in the attempt of the deceased to resist the attack made by the appellant ,ANALYSIS
e7a765b6aff04e7aba9a67b340f14899,8902,8932,There was therefore no fight ,ANALYSIS
eaf612afe6154f298ddd586c22d40457,8932,9051, This is a very half hearted finding and ignores the fact that the benefit of all doubts must be given to the accused ,ANALYSIS
d08f3af4f7574bfc94335cdb5f25d9e6,9051,9245, If it was only possible that the injury was due to Pheru s attempt to ward off an attack by the appellant then it must be equally possible that it was received in the course of a scuffle ,ANALYSIS

9bb94c510c7246118561cac8a03e6c7f,9532,9626,Why else should it be necessary for the second accused to come and hold him down by the waist ,ANALYSIS
d40c67ce5a2947188dbaa6e0a70121cc,9627,9785,When villagers or any man for that matter come to blows after hot words and an interchange of abuse there is nearly always resistance to the initial attack ,ANALYSIS

54da18fa33764726960bfd9e6aff7402,9833,9917,It must also be remembered that the incident started with the use of force by Pheru ,ANALYSIS
5bf0e1115382427f8df0a0aafe254abf,9918,9985,It was he who took hold of the basket of cow dung andoverturned it ,ANALYSIS
fccaebba2d944921bfdb07a71ddf9587,9986,10073,That occasioned the quarrel and the finding is that there was abuse and counter abuse ,ANALYSIS
c69d7e8fd26347c0b649db6b99df8a04,10074,10150,It was then that the second accused rushed in and caught Pheru by the waist ,ANALYSIS
ef2fe048dd554d3dbc8dbb1ab63259d6,10150,10442, That accused was acquitted because there was nothing to suggest that that was done in aid of the appellant s intention to assault Pheru and he was absolved of all intention to assault on his own account and the finding is that even the appellant had no such intention till the last moment ,ANALYSIS
1b6f13b34c68499fa5e7ca5498031b6e,10443,10536,If that was the case then why should the second accused rush in and hold Pheru by the waist ,ANALYSIS
f75f69e27fc944818394cb04ad07a790,10537,10709,If he had no intention to assault on his own account and none to assist the appellant in his assault the only other reasonable conclusion is that he tried to stop a fight ,ANALYSIS
53b009d9107f47ab8ccd0647906c8dba,10710,10890,It would be fair in the circumstances to reach that conclusion for the accused is as much entitled to the benefit of any doubt when a co accused is acquitted as in any other case ,ANALYSIS
eca423aa204d4828a31f8f5d18c7bdf8,10891,11032,In any case it was incumbent on the High Court to reach a more definite finding than the one given before deciding to enhance the sentence ,ANALYSIS
effe7f86703a4cb1a37fe047b6fc2e64,11032,11223, The only reason that the learned Judges give is that Pheru was unarmed and as the attack was made with a knife it cannot be said that the appellant did not act in a cruel or unusual manner ,ANALYSIS
0d8cd8dabf414af3816ffdaeb39fb746,11224,11349,Nevertheless they uphold the finding that the offence falls under section 304 Indian Penal Code and not under section 302 ,ANALYSIS
24e6782e76654693b8f520e34db5ae32,11349,11781, A question of a sentence is a matter of discretion and it is well settled that when discretion has been properly exercised along accepted judicial lines an appellate court should not interfere to the detriment of an accused person except for very strong reasons which must be disclosed on the face of the judgment see for example the observations in Dalip Singh v State of Punjab 1 and Nar Singh v State of Uttar Pradesh 2 ,PRE_RELIED

2139d85c0d3a4d18b7d6993ea75698b1,11266,11389, However the manner in which the accused reached Chennai and the guest house in question suggests a total different story ,ANALYSIS
8c8205bc4bc9467588fec9e3ca383b2d,11390,11642,The maternal uncle of the deceased PW1 states that one Jeyaraj an employee of PW5 informed him over the phone at about 6 7 p m on 30 10 2004 that the deceased Arun along with his friend Siddharth was coming to stay in the night with PW1 at Chennai ,ANALYSIS
93f58674534845d8b7ae6e8f44226497,11643,11775,A few minutes later PW1 talked to his nephew Arun who also told him that he would be coming to his uncle s house but did not come ,ANALYSIS
1e3d426f288a46499e1dedf700100738,11776,11820,Siddharth is the son of Gomti Pandian PW7 ,ANALYSIS
2135785ffef544de9e7795c1f18bb02d,11820,11950, According to her Siddharth told her that he was going to Chennai along with his friend Arun deceased to purchase some clothes ,ANALYSIS
4c2a728379024e84b026bfa87d2c4c3b,11951,12130,She was reluctant to send her son with his friend but then she talked to Arun who told her that they would be going to Chennai by bus and convinced her to send Siddharth with him ,ANALYSIS
ee9f35354039466caba37cdc0111efdc,12131,12170,She dropped Siddharth at the bus stand ,ANALYSIS
1e555361c54e40fd98fda11ae44aa29b,12171,12330,Later she came to know that her son Siddharth had gone to Chennai along with the deceased Arun and three other persons in a car which had met with an accident ,ANALYSIS
d1ba8f0916774a47bf2a59b74f1864b5,12331,12432,She was informed about this by Kala Devi PW8 whose son Mathesh had also travelled in the same car ,ANALYSIS
bf839475428545da82fa39996caf68ec,12432,12540, Thus it is clear that it was Arun deceased who convinced Siddharth s mother to send Siddharth with him ,ANALYSIS
f1b6c8a1d6e241cb955305b977738b7d,12541,12723,This witness also stated that later her son informed her that the car had met with an accident and thereafter he and Mathesh did not proceed to Chennai and returned to their homes ,ANALYSIS

b63868227fa34d0e89ad58dbd24ee71c,13104,13273,Thus it is clear that Siddharth and Mathesh were also travelling in the car and they would have also gone to Chennai but for the fact that the car met with an accident ,ANALYSIS
02788312e041483d9346c11eb529273f,13274,13360,Thereafter Siddharth and Mathesh did not proceed further and returned to their homes ,ANALYSIS
d91f8fac11974e17b9ab376853c67663,13361,13617,As such it is clear that it was not the accused who had organised the trip but it was the deceased who had organised the trip and therefore it cannot be said that the accused had taken the deceased to the guest house with the intention of killing him ,ANALYSIS

81a95541433241a3a8823d8526408c59,13810,13996,It is not disputed that 4 ml of Tidijesic was injected into the wrist of the deceased by Venki who administered 2 ml of the same substance into himself and thereafter the deceased died ,ANALYSIS
ba0f3372ccb0442a85f1f03b4c262e89,13996,14338, The evidence of Dr R Baskaran PW11 who is Professor and Head of the Department of Legal and Forensic Medicines Royapettai Government Hospital Chennai clearly shows that after chemical analysis it was found that the amount of the offending substance found in the blood of the deceased would be equal to injecting 40 ml of Tidijesic ,ANALYSIS
dfe79a7c9a3a48d7bbe2809e46622a48,14338,14427, Therefore there is no manner of doubt that the deceased died due to overdosing of drug ,ANALYSIS
9e151af860334ea6a321cca2dda99eb9,14427,14537, PW11 stated that if a 20 ml syringe is used then about 40 ml of Tidijesic could be injected in two attempts ,ANALYSIS
4148ed188cb24fd485a7b7344618bde8,14538,14604,However if a 5 ml syringe is used it would require 810 attempts ,ANALYSIS
08f08050cd26422c94c1a44dbdd5f0fc,14605,14720,He clearly states that he cannot tell when and how this 40 ml Tidijesic was injected into the body of the deceased ,ANALYSIS
7c95fb3429e74cee8b6034b474af9b36,14721,14778,He also could not state what time the death had occurred ,ANALYSIS

2b2357fb05124b0db5d7445d8ce8129c,14963,15141, Therefore his statement does not help us with regard to the time of death or with regard to the number of attempts in which the drug was injected into the body of the deceased ,ANALYSIS

2d831afcb32141e58d0d3891a4c9a917,15904,15962,This would mean that the deceased was injected only twice ,ANALYSIS
83fe50a7a3ad45a6ac7159d7beeb72b4,15962,16071, It is the case of the prosecution that on the first occasion the deceased was injected with 4 ml Tidijesic ,ANALYSIS
3123353edb7c473490dc1d6f00c56e9c,16072,16149,Therefore 36 ml could not have been injected in one go on the next occasion ,ANALYSIS

5d8ea8c71dde43d9b53ed2007bd9d4d8,16594,16670,The prosecution has failed to prove the exact time of death of the deceased ,ANALYSIS
63ab12b43c5241bb9946a12887f8a56a,16671,16748,The deceased was first injected an injection between 9 30 p m to 10 00 p m ,ANALYSIS
f7d8830133634a8190b9701204e59bf3,16749,16812,As per doctor the effect of this could end in about six hours ,ANALYSIS
f89a0c585c7b45a3b4e00eb609f1116d,16812,16940, Therefore the possibility of the deceased getting up himself in the middle of the night to inject himself cannot be ruled out ,ANALYSIS
114548448efc435cad5a908124839b89,16941,17032,There is also the possibility of his calling some other person to inject him with the drug ,ANALYSIS
523b54dad174448f8a0376317157be91,17033,17134,Even more importantly the prosecution has failed to prove where the balance 36 ml of drug came from ,ANALYSIS
54f03c71695e418aaaf0498e7d8f4ad4,17135,17162,Who got this drug and when ,ANALYSIS
8f52eaaba1d947389a4cc5c713cede09,17163,17221,There is no evidence that the accused purchased this drug ,ANALYSIS
36a983b69f0242cbb6eba564bd763a21,17222,17458,No recovery has been made from them and therefore we are of the view that though it stands proved that the deceased died due to overdose of drug the prosecution has miserably failed to link the accused with the death of the deceased ,ANALYSIS

c53d6b78e4c248e5b0f298201d0f1c47,17470,17562,The motive put forth is that R PW10 was close to accused Siva who introduced her to Arun ,ANALYSIS
43c51aa232ce4ba8a48a1302c6a23787,17563,17726,According to the case set up by the prosecution the two had developed a close relationship and were regularly chatting with each other on phone and through SMSes ,ANALYSIS
a9e171b6be9748b48c45c4acba3c39ab,17727,17863,This was not liked by Siva Accused No 1 who thereafter conspired with Chandru Accused No 2 to kill the deceased by overdosing him ,ANALYSIS
a7fa3de2fca94ad0912ef6525d1d8e5e,17864,18040,R PW10 in her statement has not at all supported the prosecution case and according to her she had never met Arun but had talked to him over phone and that too occasionally ,ANALYSIS
0cd023517eea46e3a2b7c41d1b88983c,18041,18136,She also stated that she and the deceased Arun would exchange SMSes which were usual in nature ,ANALYSIS
4a4a740d849441bcb0a963f7d78bcaf3,18136,18228, She in crossexamination denied the suggestion that she used to talk to Arun every day ,ANALYSIS
ed4d5b1f9f66462e8299f447d7cd44ba,18229,18301,She stated that they talked generally about matters relating to college ,ANALYSIS
95a95edf26ac4c5d95cea33a6979ab05,18302,18366,She also denied that she had any special relationship with Siva ,ANALYSIS
bcb542845341420e815759493c973be7,18367,18425,According to her Siva was her friend being a collegemate ,ANALYSIS
efbf035c533f4b96b0dfbd0417af8878,18426,18597,No other evidence has been led to prove that R PW10 had any special relationship with accused Siva or that she had developed any special relationship with deceased Arun ,ANALYSIS
588f793df8f4482781b3a856ca408716,18598,18712,The only evidence in this regard is the statement of R PW10 which does not support the prosecution case at all ,ANALYSIS
082b2a42a6f54e6e8270744eb5f6697d,18712,18918, In this regard it would also be pertinent to mention that in the first complaint filed by PW1 there is no mention of R PW10 much less of her having any affair with either the accused or the deceased ,ANALYSIS
27d10d6c3dac4b5e9d5067f9d08542a7,18919,19022,This was brought out for the first time only in the complaint filed four years after the death of Arun ,ANALYSIS
a64a27ed544f4712af57e928710f9fe1,19023,19083,There is no explanation for this long silence of four years ,ANALYSIS
0845c0052bdc495ba02afafccc41e0d7,19084,19158,Therefore we are clearly of the view that the motive has not been proved ,ANALYSIS
d38cdf49e8bf4e208020312f56b06d07,19159,19233,We must also remember that the accused and the deceased were good friends ,ANALYSIS
7a3835b75a494181a4b4b32f518ca800,19234,19342,They had studied for many years together and there is not even an iota of evidence about such love triangle ,ANALYSIS

2c32f741b3ce46d1a2f88d0e5902b78d,19377,19592,Both the courts below have come to the conclusion that Chandru was asked by Siva to commit the crime because Chandru was a medical student and he alone knew how to inject the substance into the body of the deceased ,ANALYSIS
4aaf5e8fd14d44988cf73d144d63df83,19593,19692,We are constrained to observe that the inference drawn by the courts below was totally ill founded ,ANALYSIS
2cf88c1c57754cc4a4ab787c78c8caa3,19693,19775,Why would Chandru kill another human being just on the asking of the accused Siva ,ANALYSIS
5aeaccd574b14ac0930fb3f35752f492,19776,19875,Chandru was a medical student studying in a profession meant to save lives and not to kill people ,ANALYSIS
1fb79bfd3e7941b29ce7f7be036bd2ff,19876,20015,From the evidence on record it stands established that the deceased was a drug addict and had been taking injectible drugs for a long time ,ANALYSIS
c0ea7b5b781348e8851d02485afd6469,20016,20085,It is well known that such drug addicts can easily inject themselves ,ANALYSIS
68601002213746f6a49d4d61493c5930,20086,20247,What has happened in this case is not clear but it cannot be said with certainty that Chandru had injected the poisonous substance into the body of the deceased ,ANALYSIS
9d6d961a8aac49ea811775e35b7b5a59,20248,20284,There is no evidence in this regard ,ANALYSIS
466f7a4c362a4428b6c5386a5a0ee601,20284,20462, As we have discussed above it was not only Siva and Chandru who were coming to Chennai with deceased Arun but Siddharth and Mathesh were also coming to Chennai in the same car ,ANALYSIS
5e1ed4196d054f1590b3fe4931b94252,20463,20527,However they went back only after the car met with an accident ,ANALYSIS
0a035bef6db74461ae639efc1edbc1e5,20528,20728,All these boys were in their late teens or early 20s and two of them got scared after the accident and they went to the homes of their relatives and from there they contacted their respective mothers ,ANALYSIS
6c7c4f43c9454573adbe1ac07a45bdaf,20729,20836,Since they had obtained permission of their mothers by giving false excuses they got scared and went back ,ANALYSIS
423211b7ac354e068edaff08fa5b1035,20837,20901,Even as per the prosecution Chandru had no motive to kill Arun ,ANALYSIS
2579a4b33f7441e19293d0b2f71bb5ef,20901,21108, Therefore the inference drawn by the High Court as well as the trial court that Siva and Chandru had conspired or had the common intention of murdering Arun is not based on any cogent or reliable evidence ,ANALYSIS
7fe051b2932d4088a857211cf956d5c7,21110,21338,14 Other than the circumstances referred to above there are other circumstances which go against the prosecution which we shall refer to now 1 Inconsistency in the statement of PW1 PW1 is the maternal uncle of the deceased ,ANALYSIS
88d7d32db4574142846388932c7dc321,21339,21493,In his first complaint made in the police station on 31 10 2004 there is no reference to R PW10 or other facts which have been stated at a later stage ,ANALYSIS
1ceabe0ce4cd4ec9a15f98be40b9d4b1,21494,21627,The private complaint filed by him four years later is contrary to the first complaint filed by him immediately after the occurrence ,ANALYSIS
53fc30955740486fb20ae8f1c78b9192,21628,21707,His explanation is that he was asked to sign on two blank papers by the police ,ANALYSIS
8e852a0935e041d9b67d10c3804866e5,21708,21840,First of all we see no reason why the police in a case of this nature would try to help the accused and shield the actual criminal ,ANALYSIS
1cb75928deb5465d857c8933d649c8f3,21841,22035,Secondly there is no material on record to show that PW1 the maternal uncle or PW 5 father of the deceased ever complained to any authority that PW1 had been forced to sign two blank papers ,ANALYSIS
f69f3c4954174c048c11ed01c351e30a,22036,22197,This is a case where the maternal uncle and the father of the deceased had approached the High Court on at least two occasions for transfer of the investigation ,ANALYSIS
be6f86398a7d4546ae6c5788f17c221f,22197,22252, They succeeded once and failed on the second occasion ,ANALYSIS
a4f0195ef4b045b88855d5ab8c3a2126,22252,22391, In case the version of PW1 that his signatures were taken on blank papers was correct then he would have definitely said so much earlier ,ANALYSIS
c71d7c336c544fc2a43923d579470015,22392,22517,He would have reported the matter to the higher authorities or made mention of this in the petitions filed in the High Court ,ANALYSIS
66966d1cb28845edb9fe4dba94d02618,22518,22698,Despite a pointed query to the counsel for the original complainant and the informant and the State they failed to point out whether any such complaint had been made by PW1 or PW5 ,ANALYSIS
311102e59bbe4797a0811705266ab05b,22699,22806,Therefore we do not accept the version of PW1 that his signatures were obtained on blank sheets of papers ,ANALYSIS
ed6f4cb05137467faf4a7fa18ee62873,22807,22871,This also casts a doubt on the veracity of the statement of PW1 ,ANALYSIS
ce540a42c7c8432689a5f31f3128066f,22873,22915,2 Delay in filing the private complaint ,ANALYSIS
88501a0365734de8b512a0d140c9cfd9,22915,23307,It is true that PW1 and PW5 were moving the High Court for transfer of the case to some other investigating agency but at the same time it would be pertinent to mention that after the chargesheet was filed against Venki by the Investigating Officer DW4 neither PW1 nor PW5 filed any protest petition to the effect that the accused appellants herein should also be arraigned as accused ,ANALYSIS
09387b2c2d7b43fb836f051a7d3104b2,23308,23404,They let the matter go on and it was only after Venki died that the private complaint was filed ,ANALYSIS
f171ab48d7774e99812a50b5c85968c6,23405,23576,There is no explanation why no protest petition was filed when the police had only made out a case against accused Venki and that too under Section 304 IPC and not murder ,ANALYSIS
1089ea744cd64082928f8ed3736b11d1,23578,23639,3 PW1 and PW5 are not coming to the Court with clean hands ,ANALYSIS
588297fff878470d8a6b54739851297d,23639,23687,The motive has been introduced after four years ,ANALYSIS
1d03d806a3ab4b8abf7f2cda2a9d12a1,23688,23837,The father and the maternal uncle of the deceased never brought up the issue of the deceased having conversations with R PW10 at any earlier stage ,ANALYSIS
5b4f8b76e7714025bfe380357b817339,23837,23917, Therefore PW1 and PW5 are not coming to the court with clean hands ,ANALYSIS
89dabe0cdc24472294a0c9aa4ce5bbf6,23918,24027,They have cooked up the story of signing on blank papers and also cooked up the story relating to the motive ,ANALYSIS
66545666166c4e4f80c5e9dea8679d2c,24028,24133,Therefore their evidence is not reliable and a person cannot be convicted on the basis of such evidence ,ANALYSIS
7a9ea8ccaa17433795868d25381b110b,24135,24267,15 All that is proved is that the deceased and the accused were sleeping in one room and the deceased died due to overdose of drug ,RATIO
846bce4028864411a327c51974600da3,24268,24350,The prosecution had miserably failed to prove that the accused injected this drug ,RATIO
245317e221d94bbfa1ab2445a5ad5b5a,24351,24457,It is the case of the prosecution that the first injection was administered by Venki which was only 4 ml ,RATIO
79176b1b56574284ae6135a6b2c304ce,24458,24596,There is possibility of the deceased injecting himself on the second occasion sometime in the middle of the night or early in the morning ,RATIO
831684d664d04ee0ba21f7ece6bfba21,24597,24778,In this context we must remember that the doctor who conducted the postmortem has not given any approximate time of death of the deceased which could have helped us in the matter ,RATIO
1e36dd52f8d94cf1a977e476df649298,24779,24888,The circumstances proved cannot lead to the inference that it is the accused alone who committed the offence ,RATIO
2e1c4747c22c488d9eac99ac34a3fb16,24889,25064,In fact the prosecution has even failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the death is homicidal in view of the inconsistencies in the medical evidence dealt by us above ,RATIO
586fad6c159346ba9fb14f792bc59298,25065,25251,Even otherwise it is not proved that it was the accused who injected the deceased and the possibility of the accused injecting himself or some other person doing so cannot be ruled out ,RATIO

c976d120d3cd4ca88e4dfd8089d34c29,5196,5330,The appellant Subhash surrendered before the Additional District Magistrate Judicial at Farrukhabad at about 4 p m on the very day ,FAC

2f77eb167fea482fb17c4ece7efd9aa3,5482,5628, The appellants denied the charge that they had committed the murder of Ram Sanehi and stated that they were involved in the case due to enmity ,ARG_PETITIONER
d781ed810dac45d4a553bffd17637a8d,5629,5706,This defence has been rejected both by the Sessions Court and the High Court ,ANALYSIS
1a258d1ea7a340ec9949ce656c7c9138,5706,5992, Before referring to the evidence in the case it has to be mentioned that the High Court had before it not only the appeal filed by the accused but also a reference made by the Sessions Court for confirma tion of the capital sentence under section 374 of the Code of CriminalProcedure ,ANALYSIS
809edec19e9e4b82b64247800f10c158,5993,6236,Time and again this Court has pointed out that on a reference for confirmation of the sentence of death the High Court is under an obligation to proceed in accordance with the provisions of sections 375 and 376 of the Criminal Procedure Code ,ANALYSIS
53faeb79b674479fa4077527ed86efea,6237,6517,Under these sections the High Court must not only see whether the order passed by the Sessions Court is correct but it is under an obligation to examine the entire evidence for itself apart from and independently of the Sessions Court s appraisal and assessment of that evidence ,ANALYSIS
6c52c432e9a044cf96ba3c4d114ba6ec,6517,6759, From the long line of decisions which have taken this view it would be enough to refer to the decisions in Jumman and ors v The State of Punjab Ram Shanker Singh ors v State of West Bengal and Bhupendra Singh v The State of Punjab ,PRE_RELIED
2f554886abb344d8b77a55ae31373629,6759,6845,The High Court has failed to show due regard to this well established position in law ,ANALYSIS
685e6d7e916e492c82365463bfbb573d,6846,7160,It did not undertake a full and independent examination of the evidence led in the case and it mainly contented itself with finding out whether the Sessions Court had in any manner erred in reaching the conclusion that the charge of murder levelled against the appellants was established beyond a reasonable doubt ,ANALYSIS
efba82a5022c47cbb0bfd9021133e528,7161,7329,The High Court is right in saying that the main question in the case was whether Bal Kishore and Kusuma Devi who were examined as eye witnesses were truthful witnesses ,ANALYSIS
717e0586626d470e9d69d3ef011e2aec,7330,7396,But then it did not subject their evidence to any minute scrutiny ,ANALYSIS
0f8d94f711dd458492e5561279399996,7396,7819, Impressed overbearingly by the circumstance that the Sessions Court had the opportunity of observing the demeanour of the witnesses the High Court apparenty thought that such an opportunity gave to the Sessions Court s judgment a mystical weight and authority even though the learned Sessions Judge had not in his judgment or while recording the evidence made any special reference to the demeanour of the witnesses ,ANALYSIS
900352921a4a4317b4d8ea0c86f1eef3,7820,8090,The High Court accepted the evidence of Ram Sanehi s children by observing that there was no material contradiction ill their evidence and that certain statements in the F I R afforded a guarantee that the two witnesses were present when their father was done to death ,ANALYSIS
86651689d79a4e21b1d4d293e2b92d98,8091,8256,We will now proceed to show how several significant circumstances either escaped the attention of the High Court or were not given their due and rightful importance ,ANALYSIS
bd39e853f20a4635bb33e98ee2484a3b,8258,8340,First as to the manner in which S I Sharma conducted investigation into the case ,ANALYSIS
334fcf9998c642d2a519acce264353d5,8341,8564,The offence took place at about 9 a m on June 9 and though the District Hospital at Farrukaabad was just 10 miles away the dead body was not received at the hospital for nearly 24 hours after the incident had taken place ,ANALYSIS
a0b2b0ced77d4f1590cabc8d215d75d5,8565,8830,The excuse offered by the prosecution that cartman was not willing to take the body at night is utterly flimsy because the Investigating officer could have easily made some alternate arrangement for despatchin the dead body for postmortem examination expeditiously ,ANALYSIS
d3a56a79a2c04924871a39e77b020404,8831,9070,With the dead body lying at the scene of offence for nearly 12 hours and thereafter at the police station for another 8 or 9 hours it was easy enough for the witnesses to mould their statements so as to accord with the nature of injuries ,ANALYSIS
dd3d8bc07a1d44178f0b83e7541a407d,9071,9298,The lnvestigating Officer did not make any note at all in the General Diary as to which witnesses were examined by him on the date of the occurrence which was obligatory upon him to do under paragraph 44 of the U P Police Act ,ANALYSIS
e2bf13c5069045dfae86025cedb4da17,9298,9416, The time when the investigation was commenced and the time when it was concluded are not mentioned in the case diary ,ANALYSIS
6ecb37bb5a0b411eb9fa3a479f970743,9416,9566, The time when the Investigating officer reached the village and the time when he returned to the police station are also not noted in the case diary ,ANALYSIS
a3ea630bcde14dfcbc5700a7ed6fb81d,9567,9713,S I Sharma stated in his evidence that several important facts concerning the investigation were being stated by him in his evidence from memory ,ANALYSIS
6d3ae857aa144c35ad16f723f1fa6855,9714,9826,He reached the scene of offence at about 2 30 p m but it was not until about 6 p m that he inspected the site ,ANALYSIS
02b1b7c47b9440b7b798012624afbd4d,9827,10167,The dead body was not removed from the scene of offence till about 9 p m and even that is open to grave doubt because the Investigating officer has admitted in his evidence that he was unable to say as to when the dead body was taken way from the spot and whether it was taken directly to the hospital or was detained somewhere on the way ,ANALYSIS
0641410968144d82a44cfd1de4ced8e4,10168,10311,He was unable to say whether it was right or wrong that the dead body remained in the village till about 4 O clock on the morning of the 10th ,ANALYSIS
3e56bdf88d704946a88439893e5bdfcc,10312,10513,Forty or fifty persons had gathered at the scene of offence when the Investigating officer arrived but the record of the case does not show that the statement of any of those persons was ever recorded ,ANALYSIS
3d9e3f6ee04145bca1249a0ea0bb81cb,10514,10731,In fact even the statement of Kusuma Devi was recorded late at night for which the reason is stated to be that her elder sister Pushpa Devi died of shock on the evening of the 9th after hearing of her father s murder ,ANALYSIS
0e4fc18abd4142ce8ef651ef607f83a2,10732,10879,It may be that Pushpa Devi died on the 9th but apart from the cause of her death the statement of Kusuma Devi need not have been held up so long ,ANALYSIS
31ec1aa9d5304479a11efd123a3c85bb,10880,10974,We are doubtful if the Investigating officer at all knew on the 9th that Pushpa Devi had died ,ANALYSIS
0336ea4c4d9e4b60a40b41db992aa564,10975,11058,He has admitted that his knowledge in that behalf was derived from hearsay reports ,ANALYSIS
64d975cda4054fbc91e535bd584b95e7,11059,11270,The appellant Subhash had surrendered before the Additional District Magistrate Farrukhabad on the afternoon of the 9th itself while the other appellant Shyam Narain was arrested at Fatehgarh at about 2 40 p m ,ANALYSIS
58a7454bf8da4f6c8ee261a0600d3dc7,11271,11432,The Investigating officer did not even know of these significant developments though they had taken place just a few miles away from the scene of investigation ,ANALYSIS
3c42fa50d5e34692966dc359b7e11a6c,11433,11533,He says that he learnt of the surrender and the arrest of the appellants on the evening of the 12th ,ANALYSIS
26f47cf472fe4400b583f867c93eb8b5,11533,11747, Mangali Prasad has been examined by the prosecution as an eye witness and his name is mentioned in the F I R as one of the four persons who arrived at the scene of offence even before the appellants had run away ,ANALYSIS
05c10c2c47b1453dad5290edfbf5e392,11748,11800,His statement was recorded 11 days later on June 20 ,ANALYSIS
b1064b17adeb476dac8cf01cbeadd7d4,11801,11916,The F I R mentions expressly that the appellants caught hold of the legs of the deceased and started dragging him ,ANALYSIS
cdf0a3b72d6d4c7fa80569a69b07d07c,11917,12142,The Investigating officer has not stated in the Panchnama of the scene of offence whether the ground was soft or hard or sandy which had great relevance on the allegation that the deceased was dragged over a certain distance ,ANALYSIS
5835121dd5ce41188dcfd1eb45a0a025,12143,12338,Finally it is surprising that the Investigating officer did not think it worthwhile to pay a visit to the field where the deceased is alleged to have gone with his children for eating Kharbuzas ,ANALYSIS
b9b0a012145641049ebccce2f0db80c6,12339,12469,Indeed he stated that he was not in a position to say if there were Kharbuzas at all in the field when the occurrence took place ,ANALYSIS
d597ab6686ee4a7eb9dc1d7b9b641a36,12469,12652, The High Court has condoned these lapses on the part of the Investigating officer with the observation that he appears to have been inexperienced and somewhat negligent ,ANALYSIS
1097f652e6d64ebdbe1e107ed50011a6,12652,12743,The Investigating officer has stated in his evidence that he had put in 7 years of service ,ANALYSIS
9afdf1b851b14d1496caf0d3dff3d100,12744,12858,It is difficult to understand on what basis the High Court attributed the lapses on his part to mere inexperience ,ANALYSIS
5e31c03928aa40658bd2a97cd2d0ff1b,12859,13103,We will presently indicate the significance of the various lapses and loopholes in investigation but to say as the High Court has done that the Investigating Officer was somewhat negligent seems to us in the circumstances a grave euphemism ,ANALYSIS
c72c9618b31b4610ae36f6e5ea9747da,13103,13235, We will now proceed to deal with the various circumstances which in our opinion render it unsafe to accept the prosecution case ,ANALYSIS
563a24d3ad5c4ff7b6e6f7c447745e25,13235,13362, Dr S C Pandiya who performed the post mortem examination has described in his evidence the injuries received by Ram Sanehi ,ANALYSIS
09aa8ebc39274f7baa9221de741e5ecd,13363,13500,In all he found 7 injuries on the dead body out of which injuries 1 3 and 7 injuries 2 and 4 and injuries 5 and 6 are interconnected ,ANALYSIS
9aa352909be340c0bdaa4d8176c9d5a1,13501,13582,Injury No 1 is described as a shot wound with its entry above the left nipple ,ANALYSIS
103c8d44ec0249d8a50cbef85200d5b5,13583,13669,Injury No 3 is described as multiple rounded abrasions on the left side of the chest ,ANALYSIS
0d4bbe53603e4b3ab3f51dc33bbf5074,13670,13764,Injury No 7 is the wound of exit on the right scapular region corresponding to injury No 1 ,ANALYSIS
e578ebb6816342ac93e61920588a7424,13765,13920,rnjury No 2 consists of 8 gunshot wounds of entry below the right nipple while injury No 4 consists of multiple rounded abrasions above the right nipple ,ANALYSIS
19d8481618f548feae0bfe7f1c1b8764,13921,14091,Injury No 5 is a gun shot wound of entry on the back of the left forearm while injury No 6 is the corresponding wound of exit near the ulnar aspect of the left forearm ,ANALYSIS
107e2bd382bb455cbd9c2978032d1bc1,14091,14288, The evidence of Dr Pandiya and the description of the injuries given by him in the post mortem report tend to show that two different kinds of firearms were used by the assailants of Ram Sanehi ,ANALYSIS
84faa1853deb4f50a9a2dd9e4d63c9c9,14289,14440,Injury No 1 was caused by a bullet and that is clear not only from the description of the injury but from what Dr Pandiya has stated in his evidence ,ANALYSIS
63074ce14ec84c9e8846161045973edc,14441,14554,He says The bullet which had entered through injury No 1 went out straight after emerging from injury No 7 ,ANALYSIS
1a3dd988337e4eea94f69e229e1970b0,14555,14600,Injuries Nos 2 and 5 were caused by pellets ,ANALYSIS
48c0a70a544f42278414b1d29902177a,14601,14736,This shows that whereas injury No 1 was caused by a firearm in the nature of a rifle injuries 2 and 5 were caused by an ordinary gun ,ANALYSIS
47ae8f7f6e5d4f71b70449b15fe45821,14737,14946,The medical evidence thus falsifies the eye witnesses account according to which the appellant Subhash alone was armed with a double barrelled gun the other appellant Shyam Narain being armed with a lathi ,ANALYSIS
eacc7c2ad6f64ae59dcabecdd994321c,14947,15161,The objective inference arising from the nature of injuries received by the deceased has a significant impact on the case of the prosecution which has been overlooked by both the Sessions Court and the High Court ,ANALYSIS
71ed2111ced74edc819f697932112bbb,15161,15404, While we are on the medical evidence it would be appropriate to mention that there was no tatooing or charring on any of the firearm injuries which according to the doctor shows that the firing was done from a distance of more than 4 feet ,ANALYSIS
a0049aad7992409daff8dbaf8ddb4318,15405,15783,In the First Information Report Bal Kishore has stated that as soon as he his father and sister reached the culvert Subhash touching the chest of Ram Sanehi with thebarrel of his gun said that he shall not leave him alive Shyam Narain thereupon exhorted Subhash not to delay and fire immediately Subhash then fired three shots in quick succession one of which mishred ,ANALYSIS
decce173b363454081107cf50173f992,15784,15983,The trend of the F I R is that Subhash fired the first two shots at Ram Sanehi from a point blank range in which event indisputably there would have been tatooing and charring around the injuries ,ANALYSIS
6db97de8e83044ffaba5be8b4c3d3a97,15984,16161,Bal Kishore has attempted to offer an explanation that what he meant to say in his compaint was that Subhash trained his gun towards Ram Sanehi s chest and not on his chest ,ANALYSIS
8d5fbfadccf84343972b6a834f607730,16161,16244, This explanation is an after thought and in the circumstances difficult to accept ,ANALYSIS
ae709e869a8b4d628544a3db1e7964f4,16245,16340,Thus in another important respect the medical evidence falsifies the case of the prose cution ,ANALYSIS
3691060895aa456b9b99f72c298d9beb,16340,16482, There is another aspect of the medical evidence which though not as important as the two aspects mentioned above may also be referred to ,ANALYSIS
10af8f2ff60f43a198b8b741baca5d89,16483,16610,The case of the prosecution is that Ram Sanehi had gone to his Kharbuza field with his son and daughter for eating Kharobuzsas ,ANALYSIS
31cfbf5809104a61a1bfc076e7dcd399,16610,16718,There is evidence that they did eat Kharbuzas and almost immediately there after they started back for home ,ANALYSIS
24f5f8ecea0347bda78e591dba325a2b,16719,16793,Within less than 5 minutes Ram Sanehi met with his deat near the culvert ,ANALYSIS
7430fcca4535484e984b20f932ca0d6a,16794,16963,The post mortem report shows that Ram Sanehi s stomach was empty which means that the evidence that he had eaten Kharbuzas just a little time before his death is untrue ,ANALYSIS
dd34a23cc81b4d72ac397a9b94bf1356,16964,17082,Bal Kishore tried to wriggle out of this situation by saying that Ram Sanehi had eaten just a small slice of Kharbuza ,ANALYSIS
5a9a34894b5246d3b54215b7613749df,17083,17285,But even there Dr Pandiya has stated that if the entire slice of Kharbuza was eaten by Ram Sanehi its remains would be found in the stomach provided there was no vomiting after the gun shot injuries ,ANALYSIS
d14b70b4307d4594b82a64e4f3471cd1,17286,17417,Since Ram Sanehi had not vomited his large intestines could not have been found to be empty if the story of his children was true ,ANALYSIS
b7d0be43a7db44918f5093c1ed0a256f,17417,17694, This last circumstance may at first sight seem trivial but its importance consists in the fact that the visit of Ram Sanehi along with his children to the Kharbuza field for the purpose of eating Kharbuzas is the very genesis of the incident which happened on June 9 1972 ,ANALYSIS
fedb496f63704aad8d1cd13bfd53be6a,17695,17981,Coupled with the circumstance that the Investigating officer did not even pay a visit to the Kharbuza field leave alone making a Panchnama thereof the conclusion is irresistible that the story that the children had accompanied their father to the Kharbuza field lacks a factual basis ,ANALYSIS
c5b6cd6ed04c41d881d4f291ab5f6d00,17983,18238,The other circumstances which render the prosecution case suspect are these 1 Ram Sanehi is alleged to have been drageed over 6 or 7 paces by the appellants but not even an abrasion was found on his back or stomach which could be attributed to dragging ,ANALYSIS
3f7ecc2700694b958ac2d6c861c6a880,18239,18492, 2 Thirty or forty persons are alleged to have collected at the sence of occurrence but Bal Kishore was not able to mention the name of even one of them and it is common ground that the Investigating officer did not record the statement of any of them ,ANALYSIS
3594112affc94110ac620adcdb78d13c,18493,18694, 3 Jhabboo Singh Shyam Lal Brij Bhushan and Mangali Prasad reached the scene of offence even before the appellants had fled away but none from amongst the first three was examined by the prosecution ,ANALYSIS
9859b9b4f9bb445995dc547316ea2dfd,18695,18823,Mangali Prasad was examined as an eye witness but he has been concurrently disbelieved by the Sessions Court and the High Court ,ANALYSIS
eee490b923734f9b9ada5e92645c3d73,18824,19179, 4 Though the motive of the offence is alleged to be that in a complaint filed by Pooran Lal against the appellant Subhash the deceased Ram Sanehi was cited as a witness Mangali Prasad s evidence shows that immediately after the firing Bal Kishore told him that Ram Sanehi was murdered because of the disputes concerning the election to the Pradhanki ,ANALYSIS
dceea388860e4d22b3c2a92bcca4d810,19180,19364,What Bal Kishore told Mangali Prasad immediately after the incident seems more probable because one Virendrapal had contested that election and the appellant Subhash had defeated him ,ANALYSIS
64ec54d107bc4380a177281d682bef6e,19365,19596,When Bal Kishore went to lodge his F I R at the police station he was accompanied by Virendrapal though an attempt was made to show that Virendrapal was only standing outside the police station and had met Bal Kishore accidently ,ANALYSIS
15bb1f5975c54f6ab92204ce03f976cc,19597,19753, 5 The story of Bal Kishore that after the appellant Subhash fired 2 shots he re loaded his gun but the re loaded cartridge misured makes hardly any sense ,ANALYSIS
b92e18cc82654acb84a98ed974c6355a,19754,19947,Subhash was armed with a double barrelled gun and having fired 2 fatal shots from a close range at his target it is unlikely that he would re load the gun and that too with only one cartridge ,ANALYSIS
71266b5e09494b29b8c4b1c54b4aa7dc,19948,20078,And if that cartridge misfired it is impossible to understand how it could be found concealed in the folds of Ram Sanehi s dhoti ,ANALYSIS
dfc1722c036a4562a143c61380982dac,20078,20248, There is only one other aspect of the matter which remains to be considered and since the High Court has placed great reliance thereon it is necessary to deal with it ,ANALYSIS
cef262430f864e508063573b84817e8c,20249,20526,The F I R which lodged at about 12 O clock at noon on the 9th itself mentions that after Ram Sanehi was murdered the appellant Subhash told his companion Shyam Narain that he himself was going to surrender before a court and that Shyam Narain should make his own arrangement ,ANALYSIS
497c49f560f648b1880a7aaf3fb8da6a,20527,20650,In fact Subhash did surrender in the court of the Additional District Magistrate Farrukhabad at about 4 p m on the 9th ,ANALYSIS
34e2b2cf486a4223951980e0d6776c67,20651,20868,What the High Court has over looked is that Subhash did not surrender in connection with the murder of Ram Sanehi but he surrendered along with the 13 or 14 other accused against whom Pooran Lal had filed a complaint ,ANALYSIS
71135c6dd71a47b5a920dc4be1070eda,20869,20991,In so far as Shyam Narain is concerned the High Court is wrong in saying that he managed somehow to get himself arrested ,ANALYSIS
a65b1a08972a480985b28902cab77ac2,20992,21219,The evidence of Constable Virendra Singh shows that Shyam Narain was arrested because he was crossing the railway lines and if he was not caught he would have been run over by the two trains coming from Kanpur and Farrukhabad ,ANALYSIS
3f5551e5373c47bdb7b4bf7287a22d5d,21220,21316,This was hardly any sensible way of making an arrangement for himself as directed by Subhash ,ANALYSIS
550b60bc7ce74733a7f146e9a88dc6e6,21317,21499,It is therefore not as if the statement attributed to Subhash in the F I R is corroborated by subsequent events so as to afford a guarantee to Bal Kishore s presence at the culvert ,ANALYSIS
903819f3d69d4c3ab0362742929b6ff7,21499,21778, We are conscious that the Sessions Court and the High Court have both held that the appellants committed the murder of Ram Sanehi but the weight of the circumstances which we have discussed above is so preponderating that even the concurrent finding cannot be allowed to stand ,RATIO
0a385fee65f748738014b411a51da3dd,21779,21899,In any event it seems to us impossible to hold that the prosecution has established its case beyond a reasonable doubt ,RATIO

683f1b1353b743229552850f01adb10d,12829,13303,Counsel submitted that the first appellant had left Bombay in 1950 and had settled down in Ahmedabad and was attending to a factory in that town that thereafter the first appellant was involved in insolvency proceedings and was unable to attend to the affairs of the company in Bombay and if on account of the pre occupation of the first appellant at Ahmedabad he was unable to visit Bombay and the goods were lost no criminal misappropriation can be attributed to him ,ANALYSIS

5610b36a2f5540c0a22150062000113c,13369,13799,The first appellant in his statement before the trial court admitted that he often went to Bombay even after he had migrated to Ahmedabad and that he visited the mill premises and got the same opened by the Gurkha watchman and he found that the heap of cloth lying in the mill was getting smaller every time he visited the mill and on inquiry he was told by the watchman that every day one basketful of sweepings was thrown away ,ANALYSIS
135ff910df104ed5a1b697e5cbec5907,13800,14055,He also stated that he was shown several places in the compound of the factory where pits had been filled up with these sweepings and that he found a small heap lying by the side of the Tulsipipe gutter and also in the warehouses in the mill premises ,ANALYSIS
f72db84229ba40aabf37327eed137bef,14056,14229,It is clear from this statement and other evidence on the record that even after he migrated to Ahmedabad the first appellant was frequently visiting the factory at Bombay ,ANALYSIS
5dc30b8c2d134a3aa72fc9b2075e133f,14230,14380,The evidence also discloses that meetings of Directors were held from time to time but the minutes of the Directors meetings have not been produced ,ANALYSIS
7f346c81fb84472b9fba0eb7f7973d87,14380,14604, The books of account of the company evidencing disbursements to the Directors of remuneration for attending the meetings and the expenses for the alleged collection and throwing away of the sweepings have not been produced ,ANALYSIS
0e14e65cc0e14f2faf6007f6d9961d78,14605,14743,It is admitted by the first appellant that the letter dated November 27 1952 was written by the second appellant under his instructions ,ANALYSIS
20ea59299ea54d1dbed55cc86d1322e5,14744,15113,In his statement at the trial the first appellant stated that he was informed of the letter dated November 26 1952 from the Textile Commissioner and that he326 could not attend the office of that officer because he was busy attending to the insolvency proceedings and that he deputed the second appellant to attend the office and to explain and discuss the position ,ANALYSIS
b84928f43c714fd2a254eef2819cf949,15114,15272,Be then stated We had informed the Commissioner that the company was prepared to pay for the cloth remaining after deducting the amount claimed as damages ,ANALYSIS
cd4bcc6f4bc446d7b14672aabcaaf4b0,15273,15543,The letter dated November 27 1952 was evidently written under the direction of the first appellant and by that letter liability to pay for the cloth after certain adjustments for losses alleged to be suffered by the company in carrying out the contract was admitted ,ANALYSIS
b89706f359ac49f78f98859fcf964382,15543,15753,By the letter dated December 4 1950 liability to deliver the cloth was admitted and by the letter dated November 27 1952 liability to pay compensation for the loss occasioned to the Government was affirmed ,ANALYSIS
25405d3daace46ae9c54d4a0c35c2b88,15754,15933,The appellants who were liable to account for the cloth over which they had dominion have failed to do so and they have rendered a false explanation for their failure to account ,ANALYSIS
cbf6022b77b3438b88f2365d058971b2,15934,16248,The High Court was of the opinion that this false defence viewed in the light of failure to produce the books of account the stock register and the complete absence of reference in the correspondence with the Textile Commissioner about the cause of disappearance established misappropriation with criminal intent ,ANALYSIS
e4a543ee83d246b7a8d849f010dc208f,16248,16390, Counsel for the first appellant contended that probably the goods passed into the possession of the mortgagees of the assets of the company ,ANALYSIS

edee225dd6254e15baa7f0ebfef80606,16467,16854,Counsel for the first appellant relying upon the observations in Shreekantiah Ramayya Munipalli v The State of Bombay 1 also contended that in any event a charge under s 409 read with s 34 of the Indian Penal Code cannot be established against the first appellant unless it is shown that at the time of misappropriation of the goods the first appellant was physically present ,PRE_NOT_RELIED
88d6dec16bb64d52b383ed1ccd31b43e,16855,17226,But the essence of liability under s 34 is to be found in the existence of a common intention animating the offenders leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of the 1 1955 1 S C R 1177 common intention and presence of the offender sought to be rendered liable under s 34 is not on the words of the statute one of the conditions of its applicability ,PRE_NOT_RELIED
7b6e8af97a8d4d8185686565dd68e208,17227,17385,As explained by Lord Sumner in Barendra Kumar Ghose v The King Emperor the leading feature of s 34 of the Indian Penal Code is participation in action ,PRE_RELIED
7c3c5148415145468bd68f1e096cc392,17386,17589,To establish joint responsibility for an offence it must of course be established that a criminal act was done by several persons the participation must be in doing the act not merely in its planning ,PRE_NOT_RELIED
019a927161004013a4b4f9f6afce27dd,17590,17774,A common intention a meeting of minds to commit an offence and participation in the commission of the offence in furtherance of that common intention invite the application of s 34 ,PRE_NOT_RELIED
10536543ce3641f29768506ad1f873d6,17775,17844,But this participation need not in all cases be by physical presence ,ANALYSIS
cc1238e37da94450a6ebf9c39194dc67,17845,18173,In offences involving physical violence normally presence at the scene of offence of the offenders sought to be rendered liable on the principle of joint liability may be necessary but such is not the case in respect of other offences where the offence consists of diverse acts which may be done at different times and places ,ANALYSIS
b923d31d86504c5bac7568d1f8db9eb8,18174,18363,In Shree Kantiah s case supra misappropriation was committed by removing goods from a Government depot and on the occasion of the removal of the goods the first accused was not present ,PRE_NOT_RELIED
34339e3f342943f3b0097b5b59fe8ad1,18364,18555,It was therefore doubtful whether he had participated in the commission of the offence and this court in those circumstances held that participation by the first accused was not established ,PRE_NOT_RELIED

1e0af26003994a2695dd03847cadb66d,18803,19033, The High Court has found that the two appellants were liable to account for the cloth over which they had dominion and they failed to account for the same and therefore each had committed the offence of criminal breach of trust ,ANALYSIS
90e01cb8dc504e5d88adf36ab5631085,19034,19609,The High Court observed In such a case if accused Nos 1 and 2 Appellants 1 2 alone were concerned with the receipt of the goods if they were dealing with the goods all the time if they were receiving communications from the Textile Commissioner s office and sending replies to 1 1924 L R 52 I A 40 52 them and if the part played by each of them is apparent from the manner in which they are shown to have dealt with this contract then it is a case of two persons entrusted with the goods and a breach of trust obviously being committed by both of them ,ANALYSIS
84f726cd23ec4242a7efb45e9a25c88d,19609,19833,It was submitted that the High Court erred in finding the appellants guilty of offences under s 409 of the Indian Penal Code when the charge framed against them was one under s 409 read with s 34 of the Indian Penal Code ,ANALYSIS
2fe003d5a5af466fba3a9d01585e8adc,19834,20008,A charge framed against the accused person referring to s 34 is but a convenient form of giving notice to him that the principle of joint liability is sought to be invoked ,ANALYSIS
737c326f8d5e48bb9c8011bf085aab52,20009,20179,Section 34 does not create an offence it merely enunciates a principle of joint liability for criminal acts done in furtherance of the common intention of the offenders ,ANALYSIS
9606f3a992054302a0581bd1b55c0a14,20180,20618,Conviction of an accused person recorded relying upon the principle of joint liability is therefore for the offence committed in furtherance of the common intention and if the reasons for conviction establish that the accused was convicted for an offence committed in furtherance of the common intention of himself and others a reference in the order recording conviction to s 34 of the Indian Penal Code may appear to be asurplusage ,ANALYSIS
829bbe09a7224d8b88c3655f2975445f,20619,20769,The order of the High Court recording the conviction of the appellants for the offence under s 409 of the Indian Penal Code is therefore not illegal ,ANALYSIS
44be2355d4a443f8922432bb99a2fa13,20769,20991, It was submitted for the first appellant that the sentence passed against him was unduly severe and that in any event no distinction should have been made between him and the second appellant in the matter of sentence ,ANALYSIS
101578f82217401399f50624c64dca1d,20992,21121,It is evident on the findings accepted by us that property of considerable value has been misappropriated by the first appellant ,ANALYSIS

1f7e3ea39aff48018440379d91c5e334,2777,2968,After further proceedings the matter having been committed to the Sessions Court charges were framed against the accused to which the accused had pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried ,FAC
14365a81aa1449a38279e53d62afe1b7,2968,3061, The prosecution then examined 15 witnesses and marked several exhibits and material objects ,FAC
3e6c463be9d149fa9e82aaa79a2cbb12,3062,3216,After examination of the accused under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 the court below framed the following points for consideration ,FAC
36ca29fc96be45a09cedc07c05a6944c,3216,3992, i Whether the prosecution has proved beyond all reasonable doubt by adducing cogent and reliable evidence stating that on 10 3 2007 at about 8 30 a m in the land Sy No 91 of Koralli the accused in furtherance of their common intention wrongfully restrained C W 2 Sharanappa to proceed in the direction in which he has right to proceed the accused caused grievous injuries to C W 2 Sharanappa by assaulting him from Talwar and knife and have attempted to commit the murder of C W 2 Sharanappa by assaulting him with Talwar and axe and accused No 3 abetted accused No 1 and 2 in the commission of the said offence and thereby the accused have committed the offence punishable under Sections 341 326 307 and 109 R w Section 34 of Indian Penal Code ii What order ,ISSUE
77238484f02440b8b6d1697673607645,3992,4159, 4 The background to the alleged offence committed by the accused was that the complainant s father had three brothers namely Gurushantappa Ranojappa and Kupendra ,FAC
8116b738235a4fd08a0608eb96f70efe,4160,4275,Kupendra was said to be no more and the family owned lands bearing Survey Number 91 94 and 95 of Koralli village ,FAC
bea914772a8047998b8e9630ea4a2199,4276,4344,Gurushantappa had divided the land between himself and his brothers ,FAC
14e5d4d85bb84e608e4c0c394410484a,4344,5105, Gurushantappa s sons namely Ratanchand and Mallikarjun were quarreling amongst themselves in connection with land bearing Survey No 91 to the effect that the complainant did not have any share in the land and had called upon him not to cultivate the land and they had also instituted proceedings before the office of the Deputy Commissioner as regards their claim in respect of the land But however the complainant was said to be cultivating the land throughout and therefore he negated the objection raised by the sons of Gurushantappa and had grown sugar cane in the said land and the brother of the complaint namely Sharanappa had obtained permission to supply sugar cane to the Bhusnoor sugar factory and had arranged for harvesting the sugar cane crop ,FAC
37a875c4af0c4ae8b672f5d0cd099011,5106,5468,On 09 03 2007 labourers had been engaged to harvest the sugar cane crop and when the operations were on at about 8 30 a m on 10 03 2007 the complainant had visited the land and at that point he saw his brother Sharanappa and his son Hanumantharaya were at the land and Ratanchand and Mallikarjun were armed with an axe and a knife and they were all quarreling ,FAC
32d4b0897c3248459860a83ddcb34e6a,5469,5651,Mallikarjun and Ratanchand were questioning Sharanappa and his nephew Hanumantharaya as to what right they had to harvest the sugar cane and thereafter had proceeded to attack them ,FAC
0b929396a9344ed4afeabab0f1a9935a,5652,6012,Ratanchand had assaulted Sharanappa with the sword on his right palm as a result of which his thumb was said to have been severed from his hand and when the complainant and Hanumantharaya tried to intervene the accused it is alleged had pushed them to the ground and continued to assault Sharanappa on his left shoulder and thereby caused grievous injuries ,FAC
e556baf3df7d4078bdbb2aa262029446,6013,6166,The accused Ratanchand once again is said to have assaulted Sharanappa on the left side of his hand and neck as a result of which he fell to the ground ,FAC
628fc15873e840a19302e903149b02e9,6167,6266,Thereafter the accused are said to have left the place on the assumption that Sharanappa was dead ,FAC
51e890de3d9f414aa0849c5dae33a4b4,6267,6373,There was a jeep standing by belonging to one Babu Kalashetty on which the accused are said to have fled ,FAC
f36d7e75556e46138882791126e552e4,6374,6511,It is further alleged that accused No 3 who was also present on the land exhorted accused Nos 1 and 2 to attack Sharanappa and kill him ,FAC
facbe34c80e4439da418d827b279c5d4,6512,6699,In the meanwhile the complainant and Hanumantharaya had brought a private jeep and thereafter they had carried Sharanappa to a Government Hospital at Aland and admitted him for treatment ,FAC
6bcdda1d8eb5440f93db44f0a17b7033,6700,6867,It is thereafter that the Police Sub Inspector Aland has visited the hospital at about 10 00 a m and recorded the statement of the complainant and registered a case ,FAC
5b0a5917dab24553bf25cdf03542667a,6868,7064,After further investigation and after gathering other material objects recording statements of other witnesses and after completion of proceedings the matter was committed to the Sessions Court ,FAC
d95a8bd7719c48f5ba04133a2e6d20f1,7064,7315, 5 It is in this background that the Court below after having found that though it could not be denied that PW 1 had suffered serious injuries the evidence in support of the alleged charges against the accused was the evidence of PWs 1 4 5 and 9 ,ANALYSIS
b8fade0d29ab4134a999a5ef23da1d12,7316,7664,It was found that PW 1 categorically denied the presence of accused No 3 and consequently he had stated in his evidence that accused No 1 assaulted him with an axe and accused No 2 assaulted him with a sword but contrary to this PWs 4 and 5 had deposed that accused No 1 assaulted Sharanappa with an axe and accused No 2 assaulted him with a sword ,ANALYSIS
d5910c6ba08b418f8baa7539e9fd357a,7665,7964,Further PW 1 in his evidence had stated that he was alone on the land but contrary to this PWs 4 and 5 had deposed that they were also present on the land at the time of the incident and that when they tried to intervene to rescue Sharanappa the accused No 1 threatened them and pushed them away ,ANALYSIS
4758519bfcee4467b851ca376dd67617,7965,8143,Therefore the Court below has seriously doubted the very presence of PW 4 and PW 5 in view of the contradictory statements and coming from the mouth of PW 1 the injured witness ,ANALYSIS
1e3e52d3a52a471993037a5313f338b7,8144,8414,The Court below has also contemplated that if really PWs 4 and 5 were also present on the land and tried to rescue Sharanappa from the accused who were armed with a sword and an axe as alleged it is difficult to understand as to how they had not sustained any injuries ,ANALYSIS
4d4b45607b084617982d9366a73285ad,8416,8700,6 Further it was also in the evidence of PWs 4 and 5 that they carried Sharanappa to hospital in a jeep and that he was heavily bleeding and their clothes were also blood stained but interestingly the Investigating Officer had not thought it fit to seize those blood stained clothes ,ANALYSIS
ca5a86d9e1514f7eb498ca6ae8e29ae4,8701,8837,Further PW 1 in his evidence has stated that at the time of incident there were 20 labourers engaged in harvesting the sugar cane crop ,ANALYSIS
9dedcc3729c54d8b91f29aa724d378da,8838,9052,However the Investigating Officer had not made any attempt to record the statement of those witnesses who were the best witnesses to speak about the incident as they would have been totally independent witnesses ,ANALYSIS
6058cba65f5741f1b823c8bb5cf37432,9053,9240,That if really such an offence had been committed as alleged in the complaint and as stated by PWs 4 and 5 the labourers who were working in the field would have witnessed the incident ,ANALYSIS
3e3563a4a2344e6c985af637ef94b1ef,9241,9660,Therefore in the absence of any such independent evidence on record the testimony of the said witnesses has been characterized as being tutored and interested testimony especially when there are material contradictions as regards the weapons seized and the manner in which the same have stated to have been employed by the accused in assaulting the injured and which is contradictorily stated by the said witnesses ,ANALYSIS
b1011d04a43e4a02b39a2f4afd62ae10,9662,9817,7 Further PWs 4 and 5 had deposed that immediately after the incident they carried Sharanappa first to the police station and thereafter to the hospital ,ANALYSIS
b3292edddde5432da7b2412debe4493b,9818,9991,But the evidence of the Investigating Officer discloses that after he was informed of the incident he had come to the hospital and recorded the statement of the complainant ,ANALYSIS
3f9a1486aaee427fa8ae9e0b9d79f01d,9991,10123, This is yet another contradiction which has been disbelieved by the Court as to the manner in which the incident may have occurred ,ANALYSIS
da4bea2c9d404ce78031b800c28a6b55,10123,10314, Apart from these witnesses there were other witnesses such as PW 9 who was a circumstantial witness of the incident and the evidence of that witness was also of no help to the prosecution ,ANALYSIS
9afb99d2c464470d97af04c0a116b592,10316,10705,8 Similarly PW 6 who was the father of PW 1 had deposed that he was in his house at the time of the incident and when he visited the land PW 1 had already been carried to the hospital for treatment and in this manner the Court below has discarded the evidence of this witness apart from PWs 10 12 and 14 who were all formal witnesses in respect of the panchanama and spot mahazar etc ,ANALYSIS
a75a506db02748cb888b59c0309aa63f,10706,10860,In fact PWs 12 and 14 who are the panch witnesses and seizure mahazar have not supported the prosecution case and they were treated as hostile witnesses ,ANALYSIS
452f94a05c8546fba1d37cb3a8a0f0c7,10862,11307,9 Further the Court below has discussed the evidence of PW 3 the Medical practitioner of the Government Hospital Aland who had stated that Sharanappa was brought by one Nagappa for treatment and that he had been assaulted with an axe and a knife and the doctor has spoken about the serious injuries which were identified as seven in number and that the patient was shifted to a larger hospital as the injuries were very grievous in nature ,ANALYSIS
4b5495c5dd1e428e855cc0644a59326d,11308,11508,Though the medical evidence clearly indicated that the victim had suffered grievous injuries the evidence of the other witnesses was not consistent in the manner as to how those injuries were caused ,ANALYSIS
f66cff5e9c69499d91635991b02f4b49,11510,11607,10 PW 1 deposed that there was a property dispute between his father and father of accused No 1 ,ANALYSIS
cc1372c84c8f423a8281eceee337d460,11608,11952,He has narrated that accused No 1 assaulted him with an axe on his right palm as a result of which the thumb got severed and accused No 2 assaulted him with an axe on his right palm and also on the wrist of his left hand and accused No 1 repeated his assault with the axe on the left portion of his chest thereafter he had lost consciousness ,ANALYSIS
feba90c8fe484d5887acbcf615fb05cd,11953,12140,He had further stated that when accused Nos 1 and 2 had attacked him there was none present on the land and that at the time of the incident accused No 3 was carrying water to her house ,ANALYSIS
9b93399455ef49a783081c281dd28463,12141,12227,However in his cross examination he had denied that accused No 3 was present at all ,ANALYSIS
14cdae5c79a7485cb4ad62ded9516c69,12227,12331, On which he was treated as a hostile witness and the prosecution has cross examined him on that aspect ,ANALYSIS
c245b5c831804012a0c287448edca8af,12331,12664, 11 PW 5 who is the son of PW 1 had stated that accused No 1 had assaulted PW 1 on his right palm with the sword as a result of which the thumb was severed and he and PW 4 intervened Accused No 2 had threatened him with the axe thereafter accused No 2 continued to assault his father with an axe on the left hand causing injuries ,ANALYSIS
3ed707ccf6fb4a57a9c0b767d3d7a3d6,12665,12759,Accused No 2 also caused injury on the left shoulder and thereafter he had lost consciousness ,ANALYSIS
bbf05aebbc024a3099e06cfcd5772aae,12760,12843,That accused No 3 was all along exhorting accused Nos 1 and 2 to murder Sharanappa ,ANALYSIS
86d61fe7a543473f802cd0be8449e8e7,12843,13388, 12 Given these inconsistencies in the case of the prosecution though it cannot be denied that PW 1 had suffered serious injuries since the manner in which the incident had unfolded and the participation of the accused as alleged being inconsistently narrated by the witnesses the trial Court has rightly felt that it was not possible to reconcile the inconsistencies and contradictions and therefore has held that prosecution has failed to bring home the charges beyond all reasonable doubt as against the accused and has acquitted them ,ANALYSIS
2bd6956e033a4e2eb893793e465511ff,13389,13659,Though the learned Additional Advocate General would make an effort to salvage the case as could be seen from the evidence tendered it is full of inconsistencies which cannot be reconciled and the trial Court has rightly acquitted the accused on the grounds as stated ,RATIO
b1aff2c02ddc48839e125974ff2c6820,13659,13739, 13 Hence there is no substance in this appeal and the same stands dismissed ,RPC

affa2dbded8f4fe4aaad3988e363ac2d,11595,11816,In the light of these principles it is clear that when the statement of the appellant was recorded by the Customs officer under s 108 the appellant was not a person accused of any offence under the Customs Act 1962 ,ANALYSIS
b5623e94b1a541ba8180015d34b91fc3,11817,12079,An accusation which would stamp him with the character of such a person was levelled only when the complaint was filed against him by the Assistant Collector of Customs complaining of the commission of offences under s 135 a and s 135 b of the Customs Act ,ANALYSIS
4fbe75dce4ba4313a5abb063132f35c5,12079,12308, True that the appellant was arrested by the police on December 12 1967 on suspicion of having committed an offence under s 124 of the Bombay Police Act and a Panchnama of the packages in the truck was also prepared ,ANALYSIS
36b94c702ca041499a868f61a31499e2,12308,12425, But the factual ingredients of that offence are materially different from those of an offence under the Customs Act ,ANALYSIS
d069cb5e22ba41a0ac79eeed591f600c,12425,13234, This will be apparent from a bare reading of s 124 of the Bombay Police Act which provides Whoever has in his possession or conveys in any manner or offers for sale or pawn anything which there is reason to believe is stolen property or property fraudulently obtained shall if he fails to account for such possession or to act to the satisfaction of the Magistrate on conviction be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year but shall not except for reasons to be recorded in writing be less taken one month and shall also be liable to the fine which may extend to five hundred rupees Even in respect of that offence the police did not register any case or enter any F I R which normally furnishes a foundation for commencing a police investigation ,STA

ff4a3da2f73444d7a5285a71f2da9724,13926,14102, Under the circumstances it was manifest that at the time when the Custom officer recorded the statement of the appellant the latter was not formally accused of any offence ,ANALYSIS
655ee00d43bc4d6983cd5b622eb8f39a,14103,14254,The High Court was therefore right in holding that the statement recorded by the Inspector of Customs was not hit by Article 20 3 of the Constitution ,ANALYSIS
f0a4e90102d94eb1b56901aa8dcfc56c,14264,14363,The next question to be considered is whether this statement was hit by s 24 of the Evidence Act ,ISSUE
e2b9ea44b19547c8861cbc7537e739df,14364,14526,The contention is that this statement was obtained under compulsion of law inasmuch as he was required to state the truth under threat of prosecution for perjury ,ANALYSIS

17c004221db947af9745e4e79582f3ae,14602,15405, To attract the prohibition enacted in s 24 Evidence Act these facts must be established i that the statement in question is a confession ii that such confession has been made by an accused person iii that it has been made to a person in authority iv that the confession has been obtained by reason of any inducement threat or promise proceeding from a person in authority v such inducement threat or promise must have reference to the charge against the accused person vi the inducement threat or promise must in the opinion of the Court be sufficient to give the accused person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him ,ANALYSIS

e757cbaa572448c58601ba9d5d9a2e2e,15488,15579,Firstly the statement in question is not a confession within the contemplation of s 24 ,ANALYSIS
0b14ce4709394025af2b9a70be67a49b,15580,15769,It is now well settled that a statement in order to amount to a confession must either admit in terms the offence or at any rate substantially all the facts which constitute the offence ,ANALYSIS
d38759d1275246d38e0c2a7368bd3d6a,15770,15856,An admission of an incriminating fact howsoever grave is not by itself a confession ,ANALYSIS
374d3cb09a744c5384383cb3fc6a11c1,15857,16097,A statement which contains an exculpatory assertion of some fact which if true would negative the offence alleged cannot amount to a confession see Pakala Narayana v R Plavinder Kaur v State of Punjab Om Prakash v State ,PRE_RELIED
b36ec8bd22ec4d7b8524934065b2f6dc,16097,16232,A perusal of the statement Ex I made by the appellant before the Inspector of Customs would show that it contained exculpatory matter ,ANALYSIS
ad091335bc1d44fe9b38e0b24af972e2,16233,16423,Therein the deponent claimed that he was not aware that the packages which were loaded in the truck were contraband goods and alleged that the goods were not loaded under his instructions ,ANALYSIS
299cd25506364e82a8bd8b9c198b3cb2,16424,16576,The deponent claimed to be an innocent traveller in the truck when he said I did not ask Mullaji driver what goods were being loaded in his lorry ,ANALYSIS
3a3e64fb608542c39aeeb5e67c8e82ec,16577,16660,Mullaji was only my friend and I was not aware of any of his mala fide activities ,ANALYSIS
c341223a2f4a4896b35cb8567e423065,16660,16833, Moreover the incriminating facts admitted in this statement do not even if taken cumulatively amount to admission of all the facts which constitute any offence ,ANALYSIS
9279a24ff55a476db70d978ad773dfd1,16834,17008,To bring home an offence under s 135 of the Customs Act in addition to the facts admitted in Ex I it had to be established further that these goods were contraband goods ,ANALYSIS
3c7409114656492f890e4002512fe6c8,17008,17158, For these reasons it could be said beyond doubt that the statement Ex 1 was not a confession within the meaning of s 24 Evidence Act ,ANALYSIS
5ad84686f8524ecbb33cd0df8fc494e4,17158,17332, Secondly it has not been shown that the Customs officer though a person in authority had offered any inducement or held out any threat or promise to the appellant ,ANALYSIS
fe9169ba57a2455384e4d7cf45573055,17332,17537, Christopher Soares the Inspector of Customs P W 4 testified that no threats coercion or inducements were used and that the statement Ex 1 was made by the appellant voluntarily ,FAC
283d176b869f477b9ccb70ef3d2f9e83,17537,17874,While it may be conceded that a person summoned by an officer of Customs to make a statement under s 108 of the Customs Act is under compulsion of law to state the truth the compulsion there under assuming it amounts to a threat does not proceed from a person in authority within the contemplation of s 24 but emanates from law ,ANALYSIS
517608aab7194c54a4e4f72458f5d3f8,17874,18393, Thirdly the mere fact that the Inspector of Customs had before recording the statement warned the deponent of the possibility of hisprosecution for perjury in case he did not make the statement truthfully cannot be construed as a threat held out by the officer which could have reasonably caused the person making the statement to suppose that he would by making that statement gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him for smuggling ,ANALYSIS
2ec8c021ecba4461a169936325d82234,18393,18530,In view of what has been said above we have no hesitation in holding that the statement Ex 1 was not barred under s 24 Evidence Act ,ANALYSIS
d5468abf9ea148119a9a312e31ffc03a,18531,18641,The statement Ex P 1 was clearly admissible under s 21 Evidence Act as an admission of incriminating facts ,ANALYSIS
8210c85edd8540f996edfb8e141d56ce,18641,19155, Lastly Mr Chaudhry tried to contend that the incriminating facts admitted in Ex 1 taken along with the other facts appearing in the evidence of prosecution witnesses were insufficient to establish an offence under s 135 Customs Act against the appellant because no notification under sub s 2 of s 123 of the Customs Act had been issued in respect of the import of the goods of the kind seized and the aid of the statutory presumption under that section was not available to the prosecution ,ANALYSIS
462335b829b547c39d06dd67369bf361,19155,19195,We are unable to accept this contention ,ANALYSIS
83483b1094ef43a9973da8bffc456d83,19196,19518,While it is true that in the absence of the requisite notification the statutory presumption under s 123 could not be invoked by the prosecution the circumstances established unerringly raise an inference with regard to all the factual ingredients of an offence under s 135 b read with s 135 ii of the Customs Act ,ANALYSIS
648a41139597452fbe0cd2de41a48e00,19519,19963,In Ex 1 which was proved by P W 4 it is admitted that these packages which were later found to contain contraband goods by the Customs authorities were surreptitiously loaded in the truck under cover of darkness at Reti Bunder sea shore from the side of sea side wall in the presence of the appellant and thereafter the first accused took the wheel while the appellant sat by his side in the truck and drove towards Sandhurst Station ,ANALYSIS
821716521bb146a5a07ffb2ebe5eac06,19964,20092,It is further admitted that some Bania paid Rs 2 000 to the appellant which was meant to be given to the driver of the truck ,ANALYSIS

c64f80603f1c41a2a9fe005f6dcb8813,20320,20489,In short the appellant had clearly admitted that these packages containing the contraband goods were imported surreptitiously from Reti Bunder under cover of darkness ,ANALYSIS

2c945b0907c44ab6b8b26d8bde6919bb,19228,19765,The appellants main contention before the High Court was that the respondent was not an aggrieved party within the meaning of s 198 of the Code that he had filed the complaint in his capacity as the chairman of the reception committee of the conference and not in his individual capacity that in the absence of any reference to him in the said news item he had no cause for complaint and that the conference being an undefined and an amorphous body the respondent as a member or part of such a body could not lodge the complaint ,ANALYSIS

009562b94c46407c8348154878498e12,20322,20650, The statement in this para that the respondent piloted and sponsored the resolution in question was factually incorrect as the respondent s evidence itself showed that the resolution was moved not by him but by the President of the conference who read it out and as no one opposed it was taken to have been approved by all ,ANALYSIS
295f1e198cf140ea87e2c4d42aa56d60,20651,20811,The only thing which the respondent claimed to have done as the chairman of the reception committee was to give shape to the draft resolution by abridging it ,ANALYSIS

30ef4f66e88c453896028ddcb99d32aa,21804,22044,The news item in question referred to the conference and not to the Dravida Kazhagam and therefore if anybody was defamed by the said news item it was the conference and not the Dravida Kazhagam which had only organised that conference ,ARG_PETITIONER
ffa103dcd37843d89b1523e36ac3992d,22045,22479,Mr Frank Anthony on the other hand urged that though it was the conference which had passed the resolution and though the news item referred to that conference and not to the Dravida Kazhagam and the respondent was not mentioned or referred to therein in substance and in effect it was the Dravida Kazhagam which was defamed for it was that party which had organised the conference and sponsored the resolutions passed thereat ,ARG_RESPONDENT
ba0cc48f21b2428aaa6390a79e542d43,22480,22777,Therefore the respondent as a leading member of that party and the chairman of the reception committee could claim that the defamatory imputations in the said news item were relatable to him and the other members of the Dravida Kazhagam and he was consequently entitled to file the complaint ,ARG_RESPONDENT
3b4c7e909cf24940858f1f85a1e4f7bd,22778,22985,On these contentions the principal question for determina tion is whether the respondent could be said to be an aggrieved person entitled to maintain the complaint within the meaning of s 198 of the Code ,ANALYSIS
d84822e6a3aa41789c7bda6b8c25140b,22986,23212,That section lays down that no magistrate shall take cognizance of an offence falling inter alia under Ch XXI of the Penal Code that is ss 499 to 502 except upon a complaint made by some persons aggrieved of such offence ,STA
fa14a7a42e6d4f37aaecb044c75cfaa7,23213,23461,Sec 198 thus lays down an exception to the general rule that a complaint can be filed by anybody whether he is an aggrieved person or not and modifies that rule by permitting only an aggrieved person to move a magistrate in cases of defamation ,STA
90571e36fb6a4b03aa574f86a5314839,23462,23725,The section is mandatory so that if a magistrate were to take cognizance of the offence of defamation on a complaint filed by one who is not an aggrieved person the trial and conviction of an accused in such a case by the magistrate would be void and illegal ,ANALYSIS
f2beb505a9504bda88681cf4adb30eb2,23725,23994, Prima facie therefore if s 193 of the Code were to be noticed by itself the complaint in the present case would be unsustainable since the news item in question did not mention the respondent nor did it contain any defamatory imputation against him individually ,ANALYSIS
3937fae0a88b47048771f621df23c7d7,23995,24341,Sec 499 of the Penal Code which defines defamation laid down that whoever by words either spoken or intended to be read or by signs etc makes or publishes any imputation concerning any person intending to harm or knowing or having reason to believe that the imputation will harm he reputation of such person is said to defame that person ,STA
ac775965bc29440386a1fc75708c71b8,24342,24423,This part of the section makes defamation in respect of an individual an offence ,ANALYSIS
aca6fd5d212b4260be62d1d3dc59b741,24423,24607, But Explanation 2 to the section lays down the rifle that it may amount to defamation to make an imputation concerning a company or an association or collection of persons as such ,STA
5e2a9ff3a09b4c9080af6da85a605792,24608,24711,A defamatory imputation against a collection of persons thus falls within the definition of defamation ,ANALYSIS
50553542534447bba0bf9ff9064fc41a,24712,24859,The languageage of the Explanation is wide and therefore besides a company or an association any collection of persons would be covered by it ,ANALYSIS
561c3bce34e34e38ae25be626396a747,24859,25066,But such a collection of persons must be an identifiable body so that it is possible to say with definiteness that a group of particular persons as distinguished from the rest of the community was defamed,ANALYSIS
9029e0e0abca4473b5557aaea08382bb,25067,25285,Therefore in a case where Explanation 2 is re sorted to the identity of the company or the association or the collection of persons must be established so as to be relatable to the defamatory words or imputations ,ANALYSIS

9c7b685687b142a58c8af986cb5d6220,1671,1832, Heard the learned Senior Advocate Shri G Sarangan appearing for the Counsel for the petitioner Shri Keshava Murthy and the learned Counsel for the respondent ,NONE
04fc9ef44ede4c5abae74a91cbb7a837,1834,2204,2 The petitioner is a registered dealer under the provisions of the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act 2003 Hereinafter referred to as the KVAT Act for brevity and is engaged in the manufacture and sale of rice bran oil cotton seed oil sunflower oil and soya oil by employing solvent extraction process out of rice bran cotton seed sunflower cake and soya seeds ,FAC
d4f3273d84ec40989a0c4ace67db9e35,2205,2296,While oil is liable to tax and the by product de oiled bran and cake is exempted from tax ,FAC
1e1c6edc4d934ab6be2e5f19b280fcc7,2298,2582,The petitioner claims that returns of turnover in Form VAT 100 for the tax periods April 2006 to March 2007 April 2007 to March 2008 April 2008 to March 2009 and April 2009 to March 2010 were filed compiled on the basis of books of accounts and the tax was paid as admitted therein ,ANALYSIS
0e73f79bd3bc45b7806ff86fece32d55,2583,2908,In the said returns filed the petitioner had claimed partial input rebate in terms of section 17 of the KVAT Act in respect of rice bran cotton seed sunflower cake and soya seeds used as input in the extraction of oil on the understanding of the law while filing returns that it was not eligible for full input tax rebate ,ANALYSIS
455277b33d2c4c4f90d322b70fd7d1c7,2909,2985,The said returns are deemed as accepted under section 38 1 of the KVAT Act ,ANALYSIS
aa648681d8954a92aa3d3aa51c66b8c8,2985,3272, 3 The first respondent audited the books of account for the tax periods April 2006 to March 2007 April 2007 to March 2008 April 2008 to March 2009 and April 2009 to March 2010 and had passed re assessment orders under section 39 1 of the KVAT Act levying tax penalty and interest ,ANALYSIS
f4c3403d18044b33b35b8ab4b83f7c13,3273,3587,In doing so the prescribed authority had allowed the partial input rebate as per Section 17 of the KVAT Act on the value of inputs namely rice bran cotton seed sunflower cake and soya seed used in the extraction of oil on the understanding of law that the petitioner is not eligible for full input tax rebate ,ANALYSIS
6fe229681c034cfc8ce9043bfccea9cc,3587,4115, 4 Subsequent to the filing of the returns a division bench of this court has rendered its judgment in M K Agro Tech Private Limited vs State of Karnataka 2014 18 KLJ 1 to the effect that when an assessee is in the business of manufacture of only one product namely oil and which is liable to tax merely because in the process of manufacture of oil certain by product arises which is sold and which is exempted from tax that would not attract the provisions of Section 17 of the KVAT Act relating to partial rebate ,PRE_RELIED
85f163a75e424eafbe4f4ae455a20263,4116,4292,This was the declaratory of the law and according to the petitioner would always have been applicable to all assessments made prior to and after the date of the said judgment ,ANALYSIS
a45fb658fb9c421d92d978cdd0ed3e19,4293,4627,Therefore the petitioner has filed an application under Section 69 1 relating to the tax period April 2006 to March 2007 April 2007 to March 2008 April 2008 to March 2009 and April 2009 to March 2010 before the first respondent for rectification of the re assessment orders and to grant full input tax rebate on the value of VAT ,ANALYSIS
dafc389182224cca8c7520c0607e7a2c,4628,4920,That was rejected only on the ground that the petitioner ought to have made a claim for full tax rebate in the first instance and no such claim having been made would preclude it from doing so since such a claim could have been made only within a period of six months and not beyond that and,ANALYSIS
2616efc19d0948ffb2adf061c22f4515,4921,5024,hence the question of considering the case of the petitioner for such full tax rebate would not arise ,ANALYSIS
d83f90189aa344c2aaf22a835e698472,5025,5293,Insofar as the judgment in M K Agro Tech supra is concerned it is applied in favour of the assesses from the date of judgment and there can be no second opinion though the revenue has sought to challenge the same before the apex court and is pending consideration ,ANALYSIS
8df675701e884783ae97691d6cd6012b,5295,5563,5 The learned Government Advocate while justifying the order would submit that the question of rectification would not arise and it is a misconception on the part of the petitioner that they could file such a rectification application within a period of five years ,ARG_RESPONDENT
e99bccdcfec2459a9b2ea6ba3d33ac1a,5564,6045,Since the statute was clear even as on the date the claim was made and in the absence of any such claim the petitioner now seeking to raise such a claim by hindsight notwithstanding that it is only after the judgment was delivered by a division bench in M K Agro Tech supra in that it has dawned on the petitioner that it could have made such an application cannot be countenanced and seeks to contend that if any such benefit is given the revenue would suffer serious loss ,ARG_RESPONDENT
6fa3640591ab484ea2d0a76eba7bfab8,6045,6406, 6 By way of reply the learned Senior Advocate would point out that it is unfair on the part of the revenue to contend that such a claim should have been made in the first instance and that the petitioner is precluded from raising such a claim as on date as it was a mutually understood position of law which prevented the assessees from raising such claim ,ARG_PETITIONER
c527efec0f51440b80962e8dc88ad2d9,6407,6765,For otherwise if such claim had been made it was quite possible that they would have been penalized for making such a claim and it is only on the legal position being settled by a decision of a division bench of this court that the benefit available to the petitioner has dawned on the petitioner and therefore the rectification application was justified ,ARG_PETITIONER
6c50f9afd32d4385b4604c11fee78704,6767,7043,7 The point for consideration would be whether the petitioner could avail the benefit of the judgment which was rendered much after the assessment order was passed and whether such reassessment orders can be passed on their prayer for rectification of the earlier assessment ,ISSUE
8bb4cf63ce3146569681460be4f63380,7043,7608, 8 In the above circumstances in a situation where if the revenue were to be in the position of the assessee and if it was discovered that by virtue of the operation of law the revenue was entitled to a certain amount from the dealers it would have certainly turned the tables on the assessee and proceeding on that presumption it would be only just and fair to direct the revenue to consider the prayer of the petitioner for rectification when there is no dispute that they were entitled to full tax rebate by virtue of the decision in M K Agro Tech supra ,PRE_RELIED
6d7050c987c1494d807de43ee8b34fc2,7609,7749,It would be a formality for the respondent to pass a rectification order and grant full tax rebate to the petitioner in terms of its prayer ,ANALYSIS
23e5691442904cd5a55dd0e0cbae9555,7751,7777,The petitions are allowed ,RPC
17a96e7c8dd447d68e93c3ba1c5b9ef4,7778,7949,The impugned orders are set aside with direction to the first respondent to redo the same and give the petitioner the full benefit of the judgment in M K Agro Tech supra ,RPC
f75ab54ab8e54c70b5201013bfbd676e,7949,8070, The respondent having challenged the judgment in M K Agro Tech supra before the apex court there is no order of stay ,RPC
