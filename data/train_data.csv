6c9d24a406a94bc1ae7c0f9449de19d3,12841,13361,The main contention of the appellant before the High Court was that section 11 2 which authorised the Government to recover a tax collected without the authority of law was beyond the competence of the State Legislature because a tax collected without the authority of law would not be a tax levied under the law and it would therefore not be open to the State to collect 1 1964 6 S C R 867 under the authority of a law enacted under entry 54 of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution any such amount ,PRE_RELIED

2df3ab9aa760461290c7217cdcb9cc6f,8992,9112,In Ramji Keshavji v Commissioner of Income tax Bombay 1 the Bombay High Court considered the scheme of s 16 1 c ,PRE_RELIED

1075a5ca55934352af16e325eaafec91,9419,9556, The relevant question for the first proviso is is this transfer revocable because it fulfils the conditions contained in the proviso ,ANALYSIS

9111093ed59341648b5f21567e7ba146,9996,10503,In tile words of Kania J as he then was the scheme appears to be that although in fact after reading the provision of s 16 1 c with proviso 1 the transfer is revocable the law will not still consider the income derived from such settlement the income of the setlor provided the settlement is not revocable for a period exceeding six years or during the lifetime of the person for whom the incomes is settled and further from which income the settlor derives no direct or indirect benefit ,ANALYSIS

4176aa9977f44c2db90298f85585bce2,11466,11814,It was observed that two conditions were necessary for the application of the third proviso to section 16 1 c 1 that the trust should not be revocable for a period exceeding six years or during the life time of the beneficiary and 2 the settlor or disponer should have no direct or indirect benefit from the income given to the beneficiary ,ANALYSIS
1a478d5a5d964db89baa933abc7e17bd,11815,12241,The following observations at page 927 are noteworthy The third proviso to s 16 1 c does not operate to exclude the income which the settlor receives as a beneficiary from liability to income tax it merely excludes that part of the income which is under the deed of settlement given to another person from liability to tax in the hands of the settlor if the conditions prescribed by the third proviso are fulfilled ,ANALYSIS
29a3327c4ff648adba96ddd4a4b79145,12242,12524,The contention raised by the Commissioner that if under the deed of trust the settlor has reserved to himself as a beneficiary any part of the income of the property settled the third proviso will not apply to the deed of trust runs contrary to the plain words of the statute ,ANALYSIS
ff9a37d708fe4cd1b32a96ecf0eb2dcc,12524,13079,The further contention of the Commissioner that the third proviso only operated in respect of deeds of settlement or dispositions which were referred to in clause c but not the deeds a settlement or disposition which by the first proviso were deem to be revocable was rejected by saying that the function of provisos 1 and 2 was plainly explanatory and it was importable to hold that the third proviso did not operate in respect of settlement dispositions or transfers which were by the first proviso revocable for the purposes of that clause ,ANALYSIS

c715a9f233924f698c14aacfb85d1fb8,13212,13613, In the light of the above principles it would not be wrong to say that the effect of the third proviso is that a settlement or disposition containing a provision for retransfer of a part of the income to the settlor would not render the whole income of the 1 13 I T R 105 2 1964 7 SCR 920 settlement chargeable in his hand provided the other conditions contained in the proviso are satisfied ,RATIO
c505d471b178491f80c689c0e97052c3,13614,13985,In other words the proviso comes to the rescue of the settlor in that the portion of the income from the trust properties which are settled on a third person is to be assessed in the hands of that person and not in the hand of the settlor if the latter does not retain any power to deflect the same for a period exceeding six years or during the lifetime of the donee ,ANALYSIS
614cd6c72cd04c7b803ba4f620fd5ecf,13986,14125,Thus the settlement as a whole win not come within the mischief of s 1 6 1 c if the revocability relates only to a part of the income ,ANALYSIS

347f18ea99524ed8abdd670751b6747e,4706,4930,It is the further case of the complainant that though he did not file any report before the Police but the Police themselves came to the Hospital and taken his left hand thumb impression thereafter concocted the FIR Ex P3 ,FAC
b6277c28474d43e8bf6d8aa1ca6be8c4,4931,5189,It is contended that thereafter some days later he came to know that the contents of the FIR registered by the Police was not as stated by him therefore he lodged a private complaint before the J M F C Naragund Court narrating the above said real facts ,FAC
ec2f7c4ced4d42a48bf0063a77e36a06,5190,5421,The learned Magistrate has registered a case for the offences punishable under Sections 324 325 326 307 504 506 2 r w 149 of I P C and Section 3 i viii of SC ST Prevention of Atrocities Act against the accused persons ,FAC
6055032376364159a72a6f18b8cf3b82,5422,5644,Thereafter the Magistrate has taken the cognizance and recorded the statements of some of the witnesses on behalf of the complainant i e to say three witnesses were examined by the complainant in that private complaint ,FAC
7197ed0c433340b7b035861814f26f04,5645,5910,As the learned Magistrate came to know that a Police case is also registered by the Police in Crime No 19 2003 for the offences under Sections 323 324 355 342 504 r w Section 34 of I P C and also Section 3 i x of SC ST Prevention of Atrocities Act 1987 ,FAC
029f8c52ae744b27840437e257ef8954,5911,5983,The learned Magistrate in fact has stayed the proceedings for some time ,FAC
801456471149491ca57770df407416cd,5983,6162, 5 It is seen from the records that the Police after due investigation submitted a charge sheet before the Special Court and a case is registered in Special SC ST CC No 6 2003 ,FAC
3022adb82785438d994cd778a7c9a7e7,6163,6326,It appears after the said case is being registered in the special case the learned Magistrate has also committed the said private complaint to the Special Court ,FAC
4ab684001ef7497286f83af6bd8ab2f3,6327,6429,In fact the Special Court has also registered the said complaint case in Special SC ST CC No 17 2004 ,FAC
9230a457e02f49f688c376b342e5ebde,6430,6686,In fact the learned Sessions Judge has proceeded with the Police report and framed the charges against the accused persons for the offences under Sections 342 324 355 504 506 of I P C and Section 3 i ii x of SC ST Prevention of Atrocities Act ,FAC
437da851b39249c8a9d97ccd92f2d143,6687,6893,The prosecution in order to prove the guilt against the accused in Special Case No 6 2003 examined 13 witnesses PWs 1 to 13 and got marked Ex P1 to P12 and also material objects 1 to 5 and closed its case ,FAC
82252e77a0fc48968b742b8e68940ed1,6893,7098, 6 The learned Sessions Judge recorded the statement of the accused persons under Section 313 of Cr P C and after hearing the arguments proceeded to pass the judgment in both the cases on the same day ,FAC
f41421e07c184ac78209480252bd3292,7100,7414,The learned Sessions Judge has taken the view that when the Police have registered the case investigated the matter and submitted the charge sheet on the same factual aspects and a private complaint is also filed on the same factual aspects but with different motives for commission of the offence by the accused ,FAC
9b88733fbdd9409d9fcf01f536264391,7415,7673,The learned Sessions Judge was of the view that proceeding with the Police report to try the accused is proper therefore in fact he dismissed the Special SC ST Case No 17 2004 as not maintainable and accused were acquitted so far as that case is concerned ,RLC
4c6bc2f904124fb7a98c85e1066c39e9,7674,7939,On the same day the learned Sessions Judge on merits discussing the evidence on record came to the conclusion that the prosecution has not proved the case against the accused persons beyond all reasonable doubt and acquitted the accused in Spl SC ST CC No 6 2003 ,RLC
4e622a0432bf4c51b9333bfdfe8ffe26,7940,8000,The above said two judgments are assailed before this Court ,FAC
59b3293d8e5647a084e15e5c1337e686,8000,8402, 7 The learned Counsel for the appellant strenuously contended that though the incident taken place with regard to the assault by the accused persons on the appellant and sustaining of injury by the appellant are same but so far as the facts relating to motive is concerned the appellant has denied in his statement in the first information report alleged to has been given by him before the Police ,ARG_PETITIONER
874194872d0b4c8f8c897952dddb674f,8403,8551,Therefore he has led the evidence before the Trial Court speaking to the truth as to what exactly happened on that particular day according to him ,ARG_PETITIONER
ebb27b2baebf406d909a8529b1219d6d,8552,8753,Though he has produced sufficient material before the Trial Court the Trial Court has not properly appreciated the evidence on record and wrongly recorded an acquittal judgment against the prosecution ,ARG_PETITIONER
b2b799bd6cb540c3a9a0402aa0458c18,8754,9181,He further contends that the evidence of PW 2 coupled with the evidence of the Doctor if it is appreciated in proper perspective along with the cross examination of the complainant which definitely show that there was some ill will and misunderstanding between the accused and as well as the complainant with reference to feeding of water to their lands with that vengeance the accused persons have committed such offences ,ARG_PETITIONER
eb43f796b9bf4f2fb2a873ec2dd57c68,9182,9296,Though the case has been amply proved before the Court the Trial Court has wrongly acquitted the accused persons ,ARG_PETITIONER
3c80b87ccfef4942b32b83851c17553b,9297,9437,Therefore this Court has to re appreciate the evidence on record and to convict the accused persons for the offences alleged against them ,ARG_PETITIONER
bfb7e7f27289414ba8274a3d18fc2189,9437,9664, 8 Per contra the learned Counsel for the respondents accused before the Trial Court contended that the materials placed before the Trial Court by the prosecution shows that there are two divergent versions stated by PW 2 ,ARG_RESPONDENT
43f952cb99c14f0693581ed2b16ec396,9665,9800,He has given the report before the Police as per Ex P3 and filed a private complaint before the learned Magistrate in C C No 493 2003 ,ARG_RESPONDENT
e14021f94e514b519f1c08758fd69fff,9801,9951,The motive factor and the factual aspects actually happened on that day has been totally deviated and two different versions have been stated by him ,ARG_RESPONDENT
02e46891bd1441cbb2dcdf1b27cfb47c,9952,10080,Therefore the Trial Court has properly appreciated the evidence holding that PW 3 is not a trust worthy witness for acceptance ,ARG_RESPONDENT
85c241d243384e7fbf66132371232344,10080,10195, He further contended that except the evidence of PW 2 there is absolutely no material to corroborate his evidence ,ARG_RESPONDENT
3ccfe3eb5f7846849bf92c1143092cf8,10196,10416,Further added to that the PW 2 himself has admitted that there was misunderstanding and ill will between himself and the accused persons that may be one of the reasons to foist a false case against the accused persons ,ARG_RESPONDENT
01fa904d88f74c7494c2461483c6e678,10417,10656,Therefore considering all the evidence circumstances prevailing in the case the Trial Court after properly appreciating the materials on record rightly acquitted the accused persons and there is no room to interfere with such a judgment ,ARG_RESPONDENT
6e7bd83cdc794f789e2f34e0743a19d3,10657,10709,Hence he pleaded for dismissal of both the appeals ,ARG_RESPONDENT
d7d7bf68737742f49065be4105f74e76,10711,11021,9 On the basis of the above rival contentions the point that would arise for consideration of this Court is that Whether the appellant has made out any reasonable or substantial ground to interfere with the judgment of acquittal passed by the Trial Court and consequently to convict the accused persons ,ISSUE
52e3fd58a13342ff8b9259994a3d9924,11023,11229,10 Before adverting to the factual matrix of this case it is just and necessary for this Court to find out whether the private complaint filed by the complainant as dismissed by the Trial Court is proper ,ANALYSIS
c08855f60a2b414e9070a28250228a5d,11229,11353, 11 As I have narrated that the appellant has filed a private complaint in C C No 493 2003 before the J M F C Naragund ,ANALYSIS
0771d39556194efabd7802362c58d6c2,11354,11599,The allegations made in the complaint with regard to the assault by the accused persons sustaining of the injuries by him are all same so far as the first information alleged to have been lodged by the complainant before the Police under Ex P3 ,ANALYSIS
16a9a710adc545aeb33dbba40e0c0ac3,11600,11995,The difference is only that in Ex P3 it is categorically narrated that on that particular date this complainant had been to the house of the accused No 1 in order to have illicit sexual relationship with the wife of accused No 1 i e accused No 2 when he went there standing near the house of accused No 1 tapped the door of the house of accused No 1 the accused No 2 did not open the door ,ANALYSIS
876a71fc119e4f08b6e74c897eca8a1d,11996,12287,By that time another accused No 1 came there and came to know about the intention of the complainant and therefore in order to teach a lesson to the complainant they assaulted the complainant and with the help of a heated iron strip burnt the different parts of the body of the complainant ,ANALYSIS
b2c998017ce34a54ba05e66a5de270a0,12288,12382,So far as the complaint averment is concerned it is altogether on a different factual matrix ,ANALYSIS
900f31e49e544c0c8d4059c668288995,12383,12580,The complainant has stated that on that particular day he was proceeding in front of the house of accused No 1 in order to go to his field at that time a dog chased him and attempted to bite him ,ANALYSIS
13842e59bd03497784b019056ffdacae,12581,12793,Therefore when he was about to beat the dog with a stick then accused persons abruptly came there and tied the complainant to a telephone pole and assaulted him and in fact burnt his body with heated iron strip ,ANALYSIS
b5b9a66e0a79430c9c21c2aa25151696,12793,13132, 12 Looking to the above said factual aspects the difference between the first information report filed before the Court and the complaint averments is only with reference to the prelude to the commission of the offence committed by the accused persons and not with regard to the actual commission of the offence by the accused persons ,ANALYSIS
65c9d1508b744383a6ffda88636dfa2b,13133,13528,Therefore in my opinion the Sessions Judge has rightly come to the conclusion that when the Police report is already there before the Court and Court has already taken cognizance on the charge sheet filed by the Police and when the Court is inquiring into the truth and falsity of the entire dispute between the parties before him there was no necessity to proceed with the private complaint ,ANALYSIS
b164ed5302004b18b1d95d8e5dce7ee5,13529,13608,Therefore it rightly dismissed the said private complaint as not maintainable ,ANALYSIS
04920e5da1004375979d05a236d4c781,13608,13908, 13 The learned Sessions Judge also dismissed the said Special Case No 17 2004 on the ground that after amendment to Section 14 to the SC ST POA Act the Special Court is the competent Court having jurisdiction to take cognizance and the cognizance taken by the learned Magistrate was bad in law ,ANALYSIS
517c0ba92c21433eb5b8a013137404bc,13909,14158,But the said observation by the learned Sessions Judge is not proper because of the simple reason the said complaint was filed by the complainant in C C No 493 2003 was in the month of February 2003 but the amendment came into force on 30 09 2003 ,ANALYSIS
73f980aa92484476bdb995dd5d447ada,14159,14310,Therefore on the date of filing of the complaint the Magistrate had got jurisdiction to take cognizance and commit the case to the Court of Sessions ,ANALYSIS
519f4aabf25c43649209f0177a65bc64,14310,14592, 14 The legal implications with regard to a private complaint being filed and the Police Report is submitted on the same facts what should be done by the Courts is also very well enunciated in a decision reported in Parmanand Sisodia Vs Madhukar reported in 2002 Crl L J 3640 ,PRE_RELIED
7532b2d4151242d6993f583e3528a489,14593,14804,The Madhya Pradesh High Court has held that When a private complaint is filed cognizance is taken by that time FIR was also filed with Police the Magistrate called the police report and charge sheet filed ,PRE_RELIED
e7461071921e4efabf9e8089b88993f5,14805,15065,The private complaint would be deemed to have been merged in police report accused were discharged by this High Court in the appeal filed against framing of charges question of permitting complainant to adduce additional evidence thereafter would not arise ,PRE_RELIED
3efc97eb593744878c353002bce98adb,15065,15423, It is further stated in the said decision that when the private complaint is deemed to be merged in the police report as envisaged under Section 210 2 of Criminal Procedure Code and in the said case the accused persons have already been discharged the question of permitting the complainant to adduce evidence in the private complaint would nor arise ,PRE_RELIED
c54df756b8c04b5ab89d33eac8c963e3,15423,15595, If the above said principle is applied in this case as I have already noted that the factual matrix regarding commission of the offence in both the cases are identical ,ANALYSIS
2e1ecf666a6c40caba658bb5613831ce,15596,15724,The offences alleged against the accused are all identical only the motive factor is different in the complainant and in Ex P3 ,ANALYSIS
68a32300a35a497586d8f1c5052a9ab7,15725,16017,When both the parties had opportunity before the Sessions Court during trial in the report submitted by the Police after framing of the charges in my opinion there was no necessity for the Trial Court to provide any more opportunity to the complainant to proceed with the private complaint ,ANALYSIS
dc6b401922ef4298b19bcfa73e16616c,16017,16155, Consequently the private complaint virtually becomes redundant and liable to be dismissed as rightly done by the learned Sessions Judge ,ANALYSIS
21dc0ae37bad42d88f5b834e387d1e3a,16156,16344,Therefore there is no ground made out by the appellant in this case in order to set aside the order passed by the learned Sessions Judge so far it relates to Special SC ST C C No 17 2004,RATIO
c6177c5055704af3bb542452e53c30ac,16344,16429, Therefore the Criminal Appeal No 2518 2012 consequently deserves to be dismissed ,RPC
dc217b717ec84a448b1c5c0ccf1df109,16429,16780, 15 Now coming to the Criminal Appeal No 2517 2012 as I have already narrated that in this case the learned Sessions Judge after analysing the evidence of all the witnesses has observed that PW 2 has failed to give proper evidence supporting the contents of Ex P3 filed by him and he has stated that he has not at all filed any report as per Ex P3 ,ANALYSIS
d6d9b614a50346eea6397eb8f877e548,16781,16871,He does not know the contents of Ex P3 but his father has filed the report to the Police ,ANALYSIS
a7f8bdfda0ee4d9a8896ea1b13f2df9b,16872,16962,But PW 4 father has stated in his evidence that his son filed a report before the Police ,ANALYSIS
f5fc0f1a8f7941caa3b085ffb77d061c,16962,17098, The learned Sessions Judge observed that the evidence of PW 4 is silent about the overt act of the accused on the date of the incident ,ANALYSIS
8c479fd49ba9490bb05b856157b38b6d,17099,17402,Therefore the testimony of PWs 2 and 3 having no consistency with each other and the other witnesses have in my opinion totally turned hostile to the prosecution case no evidence corroborating the case of the prosecution nor established satisfactorily the alleged offences against the accused persons ,ANALYSIS
a353adba680d4d2aa0d3a2bdec50bffd,17403,17475,Therefore the learned Sessions Judge has acquitted the accused persons ,ANALYSIS
39f52e5d3adf43ac89050da13a5d4a3e,17475,17669, 16 Now in order to appreciate whether the observations made by the Sessions Court is proper or not it is just and necessary to have brief look out the evidence of the prosecution witnesses ,ANALYSIS
7c8d724f2bc844f398ea5362abe25575,17669,17794, 17 PW 2 is not a relevant witness who has given only the Caste Certificate of the accused persons and as well as the PW 2 ,ANALYSIS
e6a2118c36ab49bc84f27d19b7c02f19,17795,18010,There is absolutely no allegations whatsoever in the evidence of PW 2 appellant herein that on that particular date the accused persons have abused him with any filthy language particularly referring to his caste ,ANALYSIS
d980c563efa74dcf8562d5a6eeb146c7,18011,18137,Therefore there is no semblance of evidence in order to attract any provisions much less Section 3 i x of SC ST POA Act ,ANALYSIS
1bc2ee4ca23d4a45913535e157f2fa93,18138,18204,PW 2 has so far written the complaint narrated about the incident ,ANALYSIS
97609228c42741c3b0c927f43dd6de45,18205,18255,I would like to discuss his evidence little later ,ANALYSIS
8f04f5a4cf5342689a617be670a159bd,18255,18297, 18 PW 4 is the father of the appellant ,ANALYSIS
1f43e804d35a42dbb5d5d78ab30ec6a6,18298,18354,Let me see whether he is an eye witness to the incident ,ANALYSIS
06304e729eef42608198997653bcd114,18355,18618,He deposed before the Court that on that particular day of the incident one Shettevva came to his house at about 4 30 a m and informed that PW 2 was being assaulted by the accused with incriminating articles by tying him to a telephone pole with a plastic rope ,ANALYSIS
9a408d51c3474a74ad23b198958a330c,18619,18827,Thereafter himself and Dharmappa went to the spot and found PW 2 was tied to the telephone pole and PW 2 sustained burn injuries and all the accused persons were present at the spot and PW 2 was unconscious ,ANALYSIS
a34125193bf74e5a9f927b5f9c288311,18828,18871,Thereafter PW 2 was taken to the Hospital ,ANALYSIS
e04053c118754623bc812af43eb93ff0,18872,18971,So it clearly goes to show that this witness and Dharmappa were not eye witnesses to the incident ,ANALYSIS
1c2e19ca7c6d4c20a20b2c8d21c22dfb,18972,19028,They never state any overt acts of the accused persons ,ANALYSIS
0a1845d1edec4875a001b87a7432c6b2,19029,19212,This witness also says that they called elderly person in the village and PW 3 came there and in fact advised the accused persons but the accused persons did not listen to his words ,ANALYSIS
73baded032944d3cb13845c288a50c83,19213,19325,In order to support this version PW 3 was also examined but he turned totally hostile to the prosecution case ,ANALYSIS
043ac31853d24bb5b518d0f890f18641,19326,19383,He never supported to the prosecution case to any extent ,ANALYSIS
76f9abe661af45f5b1c08ddb5c7bc67c,19384,19463,PW 5 Dharmappa Talawar in fact also deposed to the same effect as that of PW 4 ,ANALYSIS
b5aa0e6017c34dba9642a37c89ac3a1b,19464,19511,He has also not an eye witness to the incident ,ANALYSIS
e794cf64563042adb833a8566e87a6e1,19512,19630,One Irappa Kurabar is the witness to the panchnama Ex P7 under which the Police have seized MOs 1 to 3 from the spot ,ANALYSIS
ee22960b3a0b42bca80343cc0eb11e86,19631,19678,But there is no support from this witness also ,ANALYSIS
8cac1d92e9304342b1ebeb5b0d4decd8,19679,19876,Like that way PW 7 Irappa Alagawadi who was examined as an eye witness to the incident and PW 8 Surappa Ambiger PW 9 Mudakappa Bisinakoppa were also examined as eye witnesses to this incident ,ANALYSIS
ca4619d17855438786720496acf5aad3,19877,19937,But none of them have supported the case of the prosecution ,ANALYSIS

0c4667eea4c44d0988acebbe50aba965,20031,20136,There is no incriminating evidence available in the evidence of this witness against the accused persons ,ANALYSIS
ad3b48a3a3fd4f288e72f1aa02874a3b,20137,20385,PW 11 Iranna Kulkarni is the person who actually recorded the statement of PW 2 in the Police Station as per Ex P3 registered a case and sent the FIR to the Court as per Ex P10 and thereafter he sent the complainant to the Hospital for treatment ,ANALYSIS
5c8a66fe4c8747d9a3e0fe78ff58a88e,20386,20568,According to the complainant this witness is the relative of accused persons but in the evidence of PW 1 nothing is there to suggest that he is the relative of the accused persons ,ANALYSIS
279fdc6421fd44798ade2f16070da5d4,20569,20855,PW 2 in his evidence has stated that PW 11 is the relative of the accused persons but except his bald statement which was denied during the course of cross examination of the accused persons nothing is there to indicate that this Iranna Kulkarni is the relative of the accused persons ,ANALYSIS
9611e335f334480d9581ad3cbe7230fa,20856,21135,Mere saying that PW 11 is the relative of accused persons without proof and only for that reason a false first information has been prepared by PW 1 cannot be believed unless the said allegations made by PW 2 is established by cogent and convincing evidence satisfying the Court ,ANALYSIS
a74c110fa75c45efa8e97e439c34446c,21136,21213,Therefore the said allegations remain as mere allegations without any proof ,ANALYSIS
8a3f6dc41149450daf8999ce99ee65b1,21213,21423, 20 PW 12 is the Doctor of course he has supported the case of the prosecution and stated in his evidence that he has examined the complainant on 10 02 2003 at 3 00 a m and found the injuries on his person ,ANALYSIS
b9199c45117b4aae8febf8b045a6a380,21423,21535, According to PW 2 as stated by him in his complaint that the incident happened on 10 02 2003 at about 5 00 a m ,ANALYSIS
30ea652658c54839b4c4b2d720edd108,21536,21681,The evidence of the Doctor shows that the complainant stated before the Doctor that he sustained injuries with assault on 10 02 2003 at 3 00 a m ,ANALYSIS
f5a0085e60f940bdbd895374de471a68,21682,21776,The injury certificate Ex P12 also discloses that PW 2 was examined on 10 02 2003 at 1 15 p m ,ANALYSIS
fa03ad7987444e9495ac470d10f5ec22,21777,21886,The document also shows that injuries said to have been caused on 10 02 2003 at 3 00 a m due to the assault ,ANALYSIS
9fba1577c857401db14a769a2846d04b,21887,21942,This discrepancy has not been satisfactorily explained ,ANALYSIS
3a4d38b26524438e8b80651113d16bf3,21943,22036,But this particular document Ex P12 do not disclose the names of any of the accused persons ,ANALYSIS
75643a39b4c0491ba6c891a78555d3c1,22037,22124,The complainant has never stated who actually assaulted him and caused injuries on him ,ANALYSIS
d27b03fd5eb54970aa14259da640e9fb,22125,22299,The Doctor in his evidence also does not say that the complainant has disclosed the names of any of the accused persons as the assailants when he was treated in the Hospital ,ANALYSIS
ab7fabc8ae1a4b5d96deed13c5cc269f,22300,22449,The time mentioned in the injury certificate and also stated by the Doctor is far far different from that of the time stated by PW 2 in his evidence ,ANALYSIS
66c6ed4f0ccd4ec6931ead07a7859533,22450,22682,According to PW 2 the incident took place at 5 00 a m and even his father also says that the incident took place at 4 30 a m and the Doctor says that the complainant has stated before him that the incident took place at 3 00 a m ,ANALYSIS
d521acacf2264ce9b3e62e13eca4331a,22683,22728,Even Ex P12 also it is mentioned as 3 00 a m ,ANALYSIS
044c798e42974b4cad04d1ea715ae0a6,22729,22905,Therefore the Doctor s evidence shows that the complainant has sustained those injuries but it is not helpful to come to a conclusion as to who actually caused such injuries ,ANALYSIS
a786a0a38e0344c5a9906cc2547b3ab0,22905,23124, Therefore I am only left with the evidence of PW 2 no other evidence is available in order to support the case of the prosecution that the accused persons have actually assaulted the injured and caused such injuries ,ANALYSIS
7fe4dadcd1e245338aadfff775db7d3e,23124,23601, In this background now let me consider the evidence of PW 2 21 PW 2 though stated in his examination in chief that on that particular day he was proceeding in front of the house of the accused No 1 and the accused persons have assaulted him and caused such injuries But nowhere in the examination in chief he has stated what was the motive or the reason for the accused persons abruptly coming there at about 5 00 a m during the early hours and assault the complainant ,ANALYSIS
e8f225db32b3459dafe82554a721c7fa,23602,23815,It is not only the allegations of assault but it is specifically stated that the accused No 1 came with a heated iron bar and touched the different parts of the body of the complainant so as to cause burn injuries,ANALYSIS
4d3705a83be1413c858a53acc43bc0f0,23815,24051, whether there was so much of time to the accused person to go to his house and heat the iron rod and come and cause such injuries or whether the accused persons were earlier fully prepared to assault the complainant is not made known ,ANALYSIS
d340f867757b4c829df9805feba456d3,24052,24172,The motive or the intention of the accused persons has not been specifically stated by PW 2 in his examination in chief ,ANALYSIS
d2780f01aa7048e4ae119c5d16b19d89,24173,24479,Though in the cross examination it is elicited that earlier to the incident the complainant PW 2 was knowing all the accused and the accused persons were not in good terms with the complainant that too with regard to the feeding of the water from the channel to the agricultural lands of the complainant ,ANALYSIS
d7be2bb0efb4426f938f3afc08316243,24479,24706, But this particular aspect should be taken with a pinch salt assault because of the reason the motive factor and the ill will between the accused and the complainant would cut the case either of the prosecution or the defence ,ANALYSIS
84169450890e44eea936c7ec08ebbfe7,24707,24895,This motive or ill will between the accused persons and the complainant has to be taken into consideration with other surrounding circumstances and other corroborative materials on record ,ANALYSIS
437128e0b0884df6ad6e9fcbb27a62a1,24896,25197,Of course if the prosecution is able to produce sufficient materials to corroborate the evidence of the injured PW 2 then this particular ill will could have been taken for the purpose of holding that the accused persons because of their ill will and vengeance committed such an offence against PW 2 ,ANALYSIS
d32cd47af63d481bba823be121b2be99,25198,25682,If the prosecution fails to establish the case with corroborative materials in order to prove the allegations made against the accused persons this particular motive or ill will between the accused and the complainant definitely would cut the root of the prosecution case itself because it can be either way inferred by the Court because of the ill will and hatred between the accused and the complainant perhaps there is chances of foisting a false case against the accused persons ,ANALYSIS
2ed2d95bcd994f29bc0de18f249c160a,25683,25902,In view of the above said factual aspects I am of the opinion the evidence of PW 2 alone cannot be relied upon for the purpose of drawing any inference that the prosecution has proved the case beyond reasonable doubt ,ANALYSIS
add5340f34d94ee5bdd503d2c9111638,25902,25988, 22 The Police have submitted the charge sheet on the basis of the FIR as per Ex P3 ,ANALYSIS
84fb90d82004417aa596baf798d326b1,25989,26058,According to PW 2 he never given any such information to the Police ,ANALYSIS
f61cb650e7ce4461a7447137b30a9ded,26059,26370,PW 11 who is the Police Officer who is a public servant he has categorically stated that on that particular date the complainant himself went to the Police Station and gave oral complaint and PW 11 has reduced the same into writing and it was read over and after knowing the contents PW 2 has affixed his LTM ,ANALYSIS
c5ca64f24ff54bfdb1e0a5a051c97d21,26370,26469, 23 The learned Counsel contends that PW 2 knows signing putting his signature he is not a LTM ,ANALYSIS
c1f355df0bed40e7a8e3474b675b2b76,26469,26555, Therefore no occasion for PW 1 to take LTM of this PW 2 contrary to his submission ,ANALYSIS
23c950e9d99e40efa468d11c6687a22c,26556,26819,If we read the evidence of PW 2 it clearly discloses that PW 2 has deposed that due to the injuries sustained by him he became unconscious and he gained his consciousness in KIMS Hospital Hubli and Naragund Police went there and obtained his LTM on a complaint ,ANALYSIS
e7b81fd6caf04b6da572f84ab815465f,26820,26861,But they did not entertain his complaint ,ANALYSIS
3f511230fe214c858205d79fd858012c,26862,26928,So himself clearly disclosed that he has put his LTM on a report ,ANALYSIS
5de4484e642b41deb4d814a5d0823206,26929,27026,It is not his case that he has given some other report to Police other than Ex P3 to the Police ,ANALYSIS
354bd97a037d463788891990ee2b5b78,27027,27095,According to him he has filed a private complaint before the Court ,ANALYSIS
931287d1c7214adca246cbdc9256319b,27096,27185,He further deposed that his father has filed a report before the Naragund Police Station ,ANALYSIS
d2fa26dfd2c14862b4356c12d61132df,27186,27517,The evidence of PW 11 so far as this aspect is concerned the father of PW 2 he stated that on that particular date of incident the accused were advised by elders of the village but the accused did not listen on the spot then he went to Naragund Police Station narrated the incident orally and the same was reduced into writing ,ANALYSIS
236f6bf620c04e2ba02f580c6c56a0d9,27518,27593,He never states that his son PW 2 was not with him on that particular date ,ANALYSIS
c55be5e97a12431aa13c175422519b07,27594,27724,PW 2 says that his father actually came to the spot and took him to the Hospital and in the KIMS Hospital he gained consciousness ,ANALYSIS
8c95291763b640e5b29d2c5a14512882,27725,27828,Therefore after the incident his father was throughout with PW 2 till he was admitted to the hospital ,ANALYSIS
e311243f5ee54230baa615017661549d,27829,27972,Therefore it becomes doubtful circumstances as stated by PW 11 whether PWs 2 and 4 went to the Police Station and lodged the FIR as per Ex P3 ,ANALYSIS
be55514d8c9f4fc297781e79f31ec923,27973,28194,The conduct of PW 11 being the public servant as Police Officer cannot be unnecessarily doubted he has discharged his duty in accordance with law and after recording the statement of PW 2 he must have registered the case ,ANALYSIS
e04c66e8ac9d4faca0b4b762aff21fab,28194,28354, 24 The motive attributed to the accused persons and the circumstances narrated in Ex P3 in my opinion little bit relevant to consider the attitude of PW 2 ,ANALYSIS
313a0893fe3246619858a2b266c5acfc,28355,28540,As per the evidence of PW 2 he has stated that he was proceeding in front of the house of the accused No 1 and all the accused abruptly came there and assaulted him without any reason ,ANALYSIS
55650856092a4430a134c67b17cb6110,28541,29092,But in Ex P3 it is categorically stated by PW 2 that on that particular day of the incident in the early hours at about 4 00 a m he went to the house of the accused No 1 in order to have illicit sexual act with the wife of the accused No 1 and in that context the accused No 1 and other accused persons who were there near the house at that particular point of time they came little later and found the complainant near their house attempting to gain wrongful entry into the house and thereafter the accused persons have assaulted the complainant ,ANALYSIS
7af9922520ad406f9c10fb62e1b946c1,29093,29343,So in order to ward off this particular attitude of PW 2 in going to the house of accused No 1 to have illicit sexual act with the wife of the accused No 1 perhaps he must have changed his version and filed a private complaint before the Magistrate ,ANALYSIS
06c361b033b142d29cd139464529f232,29344,29512,Even assault by the accused persons for a moment is accepted perhaps the accused might have assaulted with other persons in order to teach a lesson to the complainant ,ANALYSIS
9448aba98c4442a08c5d41f61eeadfdf,29513,29632,Because according to his own admission he has gone there to have illicit sexual act with the wife of the accused No 2 ,ANALYSIS
0a89b2bb48c34a69aa55ecabd74af6c3,29633,29775,Therefore the two versions stated by the complainant in Ex P3 and in the private complaint make totally the case of the complainant doubtful ,ANALYSIS
01f268caeb8147a58d87d91b15430b0f,29776,29932,Therefore when a serious doubt is created in the mind of the Court the evidence of PW 2 cannot be made as a sole basis for convicting the accused persons ,ANALYSIS
e6c3a08e990e4a04bf06b93c7db550f2,29933,30048,Therefore I don t find any strong reasons to interfere with the judgment of acquittal recorded by the Trial Court ,ANALYSIS
ea83c95e7aee4ef09bc26b52925fa5db,30048,30687, 25 Moreover the Apex Court in a decision reported in 2013 1 Kar L J 591 SC between Govindaraju alias Govinda Vs State by Sriramapuram P S and another has laid down certain principles as to under what circumstance the Appellate Court could interfere with the judgment of acquittal recorded by the Trial Court i e to say The Appellate Court can interfere with the judgment of acquittal but normally should not substitute its views unless it records the reasons that findings recorded by the Lower Court are erroneous contrary to the settled principles of criminal law and the judgment of acquittal is perverse on facts or law ,PRE_RELIED
70f13aa162e7434385851c0992c41333,30687,30922, 26 In view of the above said factual matrix and also the circumstances of the case and the above said decision I am of the opinion the Judgment of the Trial Court is neither illegal nor capricious so as to interfere with the same ,RATIO
e2b2b73417104b59a081467b02c66ccb,30923,30976,Hence both the appeals also deserve to be dismissed ,RATIO
ff518b11b87d4f30805868ca8fbecb8d,30976,31102, 27 Accordingly the appeal preferred by the appellant in Criminal Appeal Nos 2518 2012 and 2517 2012 are hereby dismissed ,RPC
1efb15f695604c68af4004056991df60,31102,31303, As this Court has considered the case on merits the delay in preferring the Crl A No 2518 2012 is hereby condoned and accordingly I A No 1 in Crl A No 2518 2012 is disposed of Sd JUDGE Rbv,RPC

e24250ed0d1f48bab7064b0a2494b55b,5892,6142, 11 In support of the appeal filed by the accused appellant Mr R P Thote learned counsel submitted that there were contradictions in the evidence and material on record and that the Special Court erred in convicting and sentencing the accused ,ARG_PETITIONER
08f4f9f140a3487f8f912d92bd089250,6143,6854,He contended that the version of the prosecutrix was not corroborated by other witnesses that there was no evidence to prove penetration in the instant case to constitute the offence of rape as defined in Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code that the prosecutrix herself had stated in her deposition that her mother had brushed her vagina by finger before taking her to the hospital for medical examination thereby explaining the redness on parts of vagina and further that the accused was falsely implicated because the mother of the prosecutrix i e wife of the accused used to regularly fight and quarrel with him and that it was at her behest that the prosecutrix had launched a false case against him ,ARG_PETITIONER
6fcd8ee360954ce1a2c9cecae19fb774,6855,7140,The learned counsel for the accused appellant also contended that the chemical analysis reports Exhs 39 and 40 showed that neither blood nor semen was detected on the clothes of the accused or the vaginal swab thereby showing that the allegation of rape made against him was false ,ARG_PETITIONER
559f99a11c9945b780b9b301f4b80cff,7140,7434, 12 As against this Mr S M Ukey learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for the respondent State submitted that there was ample evidence and material on record to prove the case against the accused and that the Special Court was justified in convicting and sentencing the accused ,ARG_RESPONDENT
5a041f2858264dd99238208891766f0a,7435,7578,The learned A P P for the respondent State heavily relied upon the evidence of PW2 PW3 prosecutrix PW4 and PW9 to support his contentions ,ARG_RESPONDENT

8a3145ac198f43ee92366a152d47d75d,8044,8242,A perusal of Section 375 of the I P C would show that one of the most important facets in the definition of rape is penetration into parts of the body of a woman as specified in the said provision ,STA
84a06336f4884d9c95fc299711c65e45,8243,8451,Thus it becomes necessary to examine the evidence and material on record to come to a finding as to whether there was penetration in the instant case for the offence of rape to be proved against the accused ,ANALYSIS
36f96ad4b5e24c25b045f9bd95363491,8452,8705,In order to do that it would be advantageous to understand the position of law as laid down by the Hon ble Supreme Court with regard to the question of penetration in the context of the offence of rape defined in Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code ,ANALYSIS
11b45b62685443ec9f649896bbb55aca,8705,8840, 14 In its judgment in the case of State of U P vs Babul Nath supra the Hon ble Supreme Court has held as follows 8 ,PRE_RELIED
9e410d49669e4860a2cde035975de729,8841,9072,It may here be noticed that Section 375 of the IPC defines rape and the Explanation to Section 375 reads as follows Explanation Penetration is sufficient to constitute the sexual intercourse necessary to the offence of rape ,PRE_RELIED
4d42a0b7b1584492920845de01be8f47,9072,9259,From the Explanation reproduced above it is distinctly clear that ingredients which are essential for proving a charge of rape are the accomplishment of the act with force and resistance ,ANALYSIS
6937ebf00fa14e369585057dfb635e0f,9260,9481,To constitute the offence of rape neither Section 375 of IPC nor the Explanation attached thereto require that there should necessarily be complete penetration of the penis into the private part of the victim prosecutrix ,ANALYSIS
50c819fcd2844ed3941ebeb6f1bc2122,9482,9662,In other words to constitute the offence of rape it is not at all necessary that there should be complete penetration of the male organ with emission of semen and rupture of hymen ,ANALYSIS
47c6a2685f9844308b51bf03e309ebf7,9663,9944,Even partial or slightest penetration of the male organ within the labia majora or the vulva or pudenda with or without any emission of semen or even an attempt at penetration into the private part of the victim would be quite enough for the purpose of Sections 375 and 376 of IPC ,ANALYSIS
a4d41b655f3648f5b6b8644e799b840a,9945,10096,That being so it is quite possible to commit legally the offence of rape even without causing any injury to the genitals or leaving any seminal stains ,ANALYSIS
5eb9dd058c704b889598e22b6f83c8fe,10097,10410,But in the present case before us as noticed above there is more than enough evidence positively showing that there was sexual activity on the victim and she was subjected to sexual assault without which she would not have sustained injuries of the nature found on her private part by the doctor who examined her ,ANALYSIS
eab2c9eec0fd4788ba28ac89697a08d5,10411,10647, 15 It has been further held by the Hon ble Supreme Court in the case of Aman Kumar and another vs State of Haryana supra as follows 7 The rupture of hymen is by no means necessary to constitute the offence of rape ,PRE_RELIED
dc015850bcc74e838989401a1d51d2e2,10648,10777,Even a slight penetration in the vulva is sufficient to constitute the offence of rape and rupture of the hymen is not necessary ,PRE_RELIED
76462046da23400b85239c38243a670c,10778,10860,Vulva penetration with or without violence is as much rape as vaginal penetration ,PRE_RELIED
f65fa1016f97433bb7978bf3590759ed,10861,10965,The statute merely requires evidence of penetration and this may occur with the hymen remaining intact ,PRE_RELIED

3e1d30b70eda45e488a3ee579f71d174,11011,11183,It is well settled that the prosecutrix cannot be considered as accomplice and therefore her testimony cannot be equated with that of an accomplice in an offence of rape ,PRE_RELIED
3aae0d91a87e41d1940a80a8fce05aa3,11184,11263,In examination of genital organs state of hymen offers the most reliable clue ,PRE_RELIED
ce47b90203dc447a805659e406e4c70c,11263,11397, While examining the hymen certain anatomical characteristics should be remembered before assigning any significance to the findings ,PRE_RELIED
267484226a8649a49b1614374bd0891a,11398,11449,The shape and the texture of the hymen is variable ,PRE_RELIED
49b568e9791845368b221a5436f2de4a,11449,11511, This variation sometimes permits penetration without injury ,PRE_RELIED
b5ce719cb545466896cc99d83aa241d2,11512,11598,This is possible because of the peculiar shape of the orifice or increased elasticity ,PRE_RELIED
c60f992f72c3415bab4fe50e574f6ab4,11599,11710,On the other hand sometimes the hymen may be more firm less elastic and gets stretched and lacerated earlier ,PRE_RELIED
8c0fc0e322834225a85b16cf311daf24,11711,11829,Thus a relatively less forceful penetration may not give rise to injuries ordinarily possible with a forceful attempt ,PRE_RELIED
cd2e4df43b7743b0871e29f5d72f649a,11829,11929, The anatomical feature with regard to hymen which merits consideration is its anatomical situation ,PRE_RELIED
33b73cc6ab0c4f4e9944a3c4401ca373,11930,12034,Next to hymen in positive importance but more than that in frequency are the injuries on labia majora ,PRE_RELIED

ccac2c4925f64877a7b301c056c1849f,12241,12362,Further examination of the females for marks of injuries elsewhere on the body forms a very important piece of evidence ,PRE_RELIED
d27dfeb0530c4978b9d1035d406343a0,12363,12517,To constitute the offence of rape it is not necessary that there should be complete penetration of the penis with emission of semen and rupture of hymen ,PRE_RELIED
724d53ceb5fd4dca84d62b4d36ed521b,12518,12691,Partial penetration within the labia majora of the vulva or pudendum with or without emission of semen is sufficient to constitute the offence of rape as defined in the law ,PRE_RELIED

abf638524d8c45edb0da93fd8394ee8c,12785,13048,The aforesaid position of law and a perusal of Section 375 of the I P C would show that in order to constitute the offence of rape it is not at all necessary that there should be complete penetration of the male organ with emission of semen or rupture of hymen ,ANALYSIS

1e91e9767ea0465783045350fefb449a,8212,8473, The High Court however held that the shares acquired by the appellants formed a capital asset and the loss suffered by sale of 400 out of those shares in the year of account being a capital loss was not in the computation of income a permissible deduction ,RLC
dd2cfcbe58594870baf036bd8bac8444,8474,8548,The High Court dismissed the notice of motion taken out by the appellants ,RLC
1f1577cfb20a43078ebad459b787962a,8549,8814,In considering whether a transaction is or is not an adventure in the nature of trade the problem must be approached in the light of the intention of the assessee having regard to the legal requirements which are associated with the concept of trade or business ,ANALYSIS
fea0c5f1be74448db2e330c555f88755,8815,9075,The inference on this question raised by the Tribunal on the facts found is of mixed law and fact and is open to challenge before the High Court on a reference under s 66 of the Income Tax Act G Venkataswami Naidu Co v The Commissioner of Income Tax 1 ,PRE_RELIED
69aace3639ab4f32b59d880b9501f5c3,9076,9476,It was held in The Oriental Investment Co Ltd v The Commissioner of Income Tax Bombay 2 that the question whether the appellants transactions amounted to dealing in shares and properties or to investment is a mixed question of law and fact and that the legal effect of the facts found by the Tribunal on which the assessee could be treated as a dealer or an investor is a question of law ,PRE_RELIED
81b935e1ce414b0cb474a3a7bd41fbc7,9477,9593,The Tribunal held that the shares of the Dawn Mills purchased by the appellants did not become their stock in trade ,ANALYSIS
afb587b9b8da45fc81f222b5ddfb492c,9594,9899,But they held that the transaction 1 1959 SUPP S C R 646 2 1958 S C R 49 having been effected in the regular course of the business of the appellants viz the acquisition of managing agencies the loss resulting from the sale of shares was incidental to that business and was a revenue loss ,ANALYSIS
167c011832604d3f81d8058eed122333,9900,9978,It is not easy to appreciate the process by which this conclusion was reached ,ANALYSIS
3d541f7c16c443ce827ff730ed540523,9979,10160,The shares were purchased for the purpose of acquiring the managing agency of the Dawn Mills they were not purchased in the course of the appellants business as dealers in shares ,ANALYSIS
a92caa5752c34aafb4804cb651e0b5e0,10161,10563,By purchasing the shares which facilitated acquisition of the managing agency a capital asset was acquired and merely because the managing agency could be utilised for earning profit the acquisition of the shares which led to the acquisition of the managing agency could not in the absence of an intention to trade in those shares be regarded as acquisition of stock in trade of the share business ,ANALYSIS
8078ced4170d47ee9d701b65b82f9bf7,10564,10753,The appellants had undoubtedly purchased the shares of the Dawn Mills with money borrowed at interest but that circumstance by itself does not evidence an intention to trade in the shares ,ANALYSIS
b1e8c4d24c054cbab746f8e85432c713,10754,10946,Nor is the fact that the appellants are dealers in hares and their Memorandum of Association authorises them to carry on business in shares of any importance in the circumstances of this case ,ANALYSIS
8178f37fec194e4c8872d08b4fed4323,10947,11132,The appellants by entering the shares of the Dawn Mills in their statement of shares in which trading transactions were carried on could not alter the real character of the acquisition ,ANALYSIS
13d7491f9c854049a98318e5010bbe5d,11133,11269,The appellants were undoubtedly dealers in shares but the transaction in the Dawn Mills shares was ex facie not a business transaction ,ANALYSIS
2f87d45b38bb4c379c7c00a9f31e87e0,11270,11424,The current market rate at the date of purchase was Rs 1 610 per share whereas the appellants acquired the shares at the rate of Rs 2 321 8 0 per share ,ANALYSIS
4bb331c32cff482091f389e974caabf2,11425,11501,Even assuming that the appellants acquired the entire block of 2 507 shares ,ANALYSIS
4ae874bf0efa473f82f28627d7d3d58e,11502,11727,from M s Sassoon J David Co Ltd the shares transferred to the names of the Directors being held by them merely as nominees of the appellants the price per share was considerably in excess of the prevailing market rate ,ANALYSIS
dbfde83b43d64aedbe1e1ccf7bba586e,11728,11893,The only reason for entering into the transaction which could not otherwise be regarded as a prudent business transaction was theacquisition of the managing agency ,ANALYSIS
2fdcda4e740a44c39e611e20fbf6ec7d,11894,12207,If the purpose of the acquisition of a large block of shares at a price which exceeded the current market price by a million rupees was the acquisition of the managing agency the inference is inevitable that intention in purchasing shares was not to acquire them as part of the trade of the appellants in shares ,ANALYSIS
0dc96605bad44a70b1e0981fc038697c,12208,12334,The Tribunal found that the Dawn Mills shares were acquired by the appellants for obtaining the managing agency of the Mills ,ANALYSIS
705e6886ad8545d3a04d3b55b008694d,12335,12561,The agency was acquired by virtue of the vot ing power which the appellants obtained having purchased a very large block of shares and for acquiring the managing agency the appellants did not pay any distinct consideration ,ANALYSIS
f2917b056d8e413d8154b501d6e0f3cb,12562,12790,The managing agency is manifestly the source of profit of the appellants but the shares purchased and the managing agency acquired were both assets of a capital nature and did not constitute stock in trade of a trading venture ,ANALYSIS
231f82d8af464deaa3015470f5177590,12791,13050,If the shares were acquired for obtaining control over the managing agency of the Dawn Mills the fact that the acquisition of the shares was integrated with the acquisition of the managing agency did not affect the character of the acquisition of the hares ,ANALYSIS
5ec4414c59734ffc8b08f30a98c0740b,13051,13212,Subsequent disposal of some out of the shares by the appellants could also not convert what was a capital acquisition into an acquisition in the nature of trade ,ANALYSIS
7bdbfbd415d5414d910a110422ec44b1,13212,13413, The High Court was therefore right in holding that the acquisition of the managing agency was an acquisition of a capital asset and the loss incurred by sale of the 400 shares was of a capital nature ,RPC
c5c734a1659244a1a28d166a29e491c9,13414,13566,The High Court was also right in dismissing the notice of motion for an order directing the Tribunal to refer the questions suggested by the appellants ,RPC
45fb812884954bc7bd032dc2a092bd5b,13567,13863,If the acquisition of the shares was not acquisition of a stock intrade but of a capital asset the appellants by valuing the shares at cost or market price whichever was lower could not bring the difference between the purchase price and the valuation made by them into their trading account ,RPC
b23168c8b2114fcba92065a82ddae5ac,13863,13919, The appeal therefore fails and is dismissed with costs ,RPC

5c9494f82468444eb74b1c9533173833,12256,12548, 10 As can be seen from the reading of paras 46 and 47 of the High Court judgment it has taken a categorical view that the moment substantial expansion is completed as per Section 80 IC 8 ix the statutory definition of initial assessment year Section 80 IC 8 v comes into play ,ANALYSIS
8a24ac1b02bc4341b7f752c0e12c2d54,12549,12810,As a consequence Section 80 IC 3 ii would entitle the unit to hundred per cent deduction for five years commencing with completion of substantial expansion followed by twenty five per cent deduction for next five years i e subject to maximum of ten years ,ANALYSIS
2ed5b3b7afdd441282a329f2c95feb9b,12811,13171,Thus the High Court accepts that when the substantial expansion is done in a particular Assessment Year and that is made during the period mentioned in sub section 2 of Section 80 IC not only benefit admissible under Section 80 IC shall get triggered the year in which such substantial expansion is completed is to be treated as initial assessment year ,ANALYSIS

27c29ff974f34f9c82631080ff166dc9,14936,15317,It is thus clear that the High Court has failed to appreciate that the provisions of Section 80 IC 6 of the Act state that the total period of deduction under Section 80 IC and Section 80 IB cannot exceed ten assessment years only if the manufacturing unit was claiming deduction under second proviso to Section 80 IB 4 of the Act i e units located in the North Eastern State ,ANALYSIS

f4dce8b02d534395a3b3b605a20ab720,16297,16613,If the assessee had earlier availed deduction under Section 80 IA and Section 80 IB that would be of no concern inasmuch as on carrying out substantial expansion which was carried out and completed in the Assessment Year 2006 07 the assessee became entitled to deduction under Section 80 IC from the initial year ,ANALYSIS
6a396b71be4f4b69b414a588db85b074,16614,16857,The term initial year is referable to the year in which substantial expansion has been completed which legal position is stated by the High Court itself and even accepted by the Department as it has not challenged that part of the judgment ,ANALYSIS

f2f3c55ff6d94ffc82357087499fc4b3,17149,17501,By making specific provision of this kind the Legislature has shown its intent namely where the industry is not located in North Eastern State the period for which deduction is availed earlier by an assessee under Section 80 IA and Section 80 IB will not be reckoned for the purpose of availing benefit of deduction under Section 80 IC of the Act ,ANALYSIS
1343aca547bc4b55ba49c7682463d4d0,17501,17673, 13 Learned counsel for the Revenue could not dispute that sub section 6 of Section 80 IC would get attracted when the industry is located in the North Eastern Region ,ANALYSIS
b5a038f3acb240dfa59ee3707e78a4a7,17674,17988,Having faced with this situation he raised an altogether different argument for consideration by referring to Section 15C of the Income Tax Act 1922 hereinafter referred to as the 1922 Act which was also a provision which granted exemption from income in respect of newly established industrial undertaking ,ANALYSIS
018b8bb59c0c489a93e5efc62292ef12,17989,18079,He submitted that this Court in Textile Machinery Corporation Limited Calcutta v ,ANALYSIS
f2d76ea114244a51b3ba84153ce6bd1b,18079,18537,The Commissioner of Income Tax West Bengal Calcutta1 has held that the true test for ascertaining whether industrial undertaking is formed by reconstruction of business already in existence which was the expression used in Section 15C of 1922 Act is not whether the new industrial undertaking connotes expansion of the existing business of the assessee but whether it is a new and identifiable undertaking separate and distinct from existing business ,ANALYSIS
7e5c47eb4c0847ef989ae36002817de7,18538,18725,In fine the endeavour of learned senior counsel was that the assessee cannot be treated as an industrial undertaking which has reconstructed the business i e made substantial expansion ,ANALYSIS
f859141e0ed64ca6b870c3fb242dc0ac,18726,19071,This argument has to be rejected for at least two reasons 1 1977 2 SCC 368 Page 13 of 15 Civil Appeal No s 4765 4766 of 2018 Anr i Section 15C of the 1922 Act provided exemption from tax to newly established industrial undertaking if they are not formed by reconstruction of business already in existence ,ANALYSIS
99654bbbea4540288c73e982d30dfb29,19072,19269,Thus under the said provision if it was found that an industrial undertaking is formed by reconstruction of business already in existence then it was entitled to any exemption under Section 15C ,ANALYSIS
a85f4c7480254a559f527aadd1f257da,19270,19360,It is in that context the Court was considering the meaning of reconstruction of business ,ANALYSIS

2bf524fc96a544caaec12a88d7b6e256,19439,19533,Thus discussion contained in the said judgment would have no application to the instant case ,ANALYSIS
8fcd5bb76a1a4e26bb142d55c7a52d9e,19533,19725, ii Insofar as the factum of substantial expansion of the assessee s unit in the Assessment Year 2006 07 is concerned the same is not subject matter of any controversy in the instant case ,ANALYSIS
80e7b97130924fd8bf09bc389310787c,19726,19817,It has been accepted by the Department that assessee had carried out substantial expansion ,ANALYSIS
7b9e51f12e1946159d8b93d2d038a0e2,19818,19916,Precisely for this reason the AO had allowed deduction for Assessment Years 2006 07 and 2007 08 ,ANALYSIS
a2f59e4dc34c48eda282ea7a753fe1b7,19917,19995,Therefore issue is not as to whether there is a substantial expansion or not ,ANALYSIS
8d2e05d240ef49dd97ab4d4a4e7915d0,19996,20260,The issue is only as to how a period of ten years is to be calculated namely whether those Assessment Years in respect of which deduction under Section 80 IA and Section 80 IB was allowed are to be counted for the purpose of giving deduction under Section 80 IC ,ANALYSIS
82d0d558ff874c0ba7e124dd1833325e,20260,20440, 14 Thus we are of the opinion that it was wrong on the part of the AO not to allow deduction to the assessee under Section 80 IC for the Assessment Years 2008 09 and 2009 2010 ,RATIO

2b5e4bd9dcac4801b928fa1d67972e20,7495,7641,The question did not relate to the three quarters for which the assessee had filed no returns and assessments were made under s 10 4 of the Act ,ANALYSIS
5f27470c423e4a6e8000b4dfcdc9fcf2,7642,7893,At one place in its judgment the High Court referred to a slight inaccuracy in the question framed but it did not reframe the question so as to widen its scope and include the three quarters for which assessments were made under s 10 4 of the Act ,ANALYSIS
a86a5e761b8d4d9f8a16dfde893103f0,7894,8056,The question as it stood and as it was answered by the High Court did not relate to the propriety or legality of the assessments made under s 10 4 of the Act ,ANALYSIS
e5b121d7a6bc41eaabf68a7c6d551262,8057,8300,We must therefore make it clear at the very outset that the question relates to those four quarters only for which assessments were made under s 10 2 b of the Act and the answer given to the question will govern those four quarters only ,ANALYSIS
a4b27df8e64945f288712063a6cdb4bb,8301,8448,Having thus indicated the precise scope of the question referred to the High Court we proceed now to consider the main contention of the assessee ,ANALYSIS
0d33099f294c431cb5937ce2b55d2632,8449,8544,We must first read the relevant provisions of the statuteunder which the assessments were made ,ANALYSIS
a4618b9ad68646359e08b8a6724f78ce,8545,8882,Sub section 1 of s 10 of the Act states that if the Commissioner is satisfied without requiring the presence of a registered dealer or the production by him of any evidence that the returns furnished in respect of any period are correct and complete he shall assess the amount of tax due from the dealer on the basis of such returns ,STA
1c3ac1a92dce420e8b8c9c74adbba305,8883,9416,Clause a of sub s 2 states what the Commissioner shall do if he is not satisfied without requiring the presence of a registered dealer who furnished the returns or production of evidence that the returns furnished in respect of any period are correct and complete the clause states that in that event the Commissioner shall serve on the dealer a notice in the prescribed manner requiring him either to attend in person or to produce or cause to be produced any evidence on which such dealer may rely in support of his returns ,STA
f96ae533efa54cd8aa86b9d7b9bf08af,9417,9759,Then comes cl b of sub s 2 which must be quoted in extenso b On the day specified in the notice or as soon afterwards as may be the Commissioner after hearing such evidence as the dealer may produce and such other evidence as the Commissioner may require on specified points shall assess the amount of tax due from the dealer ,STA
74c584ba673b4593ab20f03fc006d46f,9759,9855, These provisions are similar to the provisions contained in s 23 of the Indian Income tax Act ,ANALYSIS
b11bb4f55ee24deeac67999c78ad02d9,9856,10250,Sub section 1 of s 10 of the Act corresponds to sub s 1 of s 23 of the Indian Income tax Act clause a of sub s 2 of s 10 of the Act corresponds to sub s 2 of s 23 of the Indian Income tax Act and clause b of sub s 2 of S 10 of the Act corresponds to sub s 3 of s 23 of the Indian Income tax Act though there are some verbal differences between the two provisions ,ANALYSIS
57a4f4ff7d984170a68dc51cdfd2a57f,10251,10658,Sub section 3 of s 23 of the Indian Income tax Act requires the Income tax Officer to assess the total income of the assessee and determine the sum payable by him on the basis of such assessment by an order in writing but cl b of sub s 2 of s 10 of the Act requires the Commissioner to assess the amount of tax due from the dealer and does not impose any liability as to an order in writing ,STA
7e8cb74f611d4298a11708b7d190db1e,10659,10935,In spite of these differences thetwo provisions are substantially the same and impose on the assessing authority a duty to assess the tax after hearing such evidence as the dealer may produce and such other evidence as the assessing authority may require on specified points ,ANALYSIS
044cd4c9139949219084e87a35663e14,10935,11178, The point for our consideration is can the assessing authority purporting to act under s 10 2 b of the Act assess the amount of tax due from a dealer more or less arbitrarily or without basing the assessment on any materials whatsoever ,ISSUE
eaf2c9c10c0f490c885cb4cac5d61851,11179,11364,In the question referred to the High Court the expression used is make an assessment on any figure of gross turnover without giving any basis to justify the adoption of that figure ,ANALYSIS
b78a755c7ea44f72b7c9cb51a1b67ece,11365,11643,That expression is perhaps a little ambiguous but read in the context of the statement of the case the question can only mean this can the assessing authority adopt a figure of gross turnover by pure guess and without referring to any materials on which the figure is based ,ANALYSIS
04d18d22330a498d97ac4f5bf68c2ec9,11644,11747,It is clear to us that understood in that sense the High Court has answered the question incorrectly ,ANALYSIS
a438c8cfdd6d49659bd56b64c75642ad,11748,11896,The High Court went into an elaborate consideration by way of comparison and contrast of sub s 4 and el b of sub s 2 of s 10 of the Act ,ANALYSIS
e8ab29ede9994799917316c800a1c822,11897,12221,It is unnecessary for us to make any pronouncement in this appeal with regard to the precise scope of sub s 4 of s 10 of the Act which corresponds more or less to sub s 4 of s 23 of the Indian Income tax Act nor is it necessary for us to decide if an assessment made under el b of sub s 2 of s 10 of the Act,ANALYSIS
6d266cbfdf17478399186c155e8714ea,12221,12414, when the account books of the assessee are disbelieved stands exactly on the same footing as an assessment made under sub s 4 of s 10 when the assessee has failed to furnish his returns ,ANALYSIS
0e10a8234cd24f9cb881ff7c19c64cda,12415,12622,In some decisions relating to the corresponding provisions of the Indian Income tax Act it has been said that the difference between the two is one of degree only the one being more summary than the other ,ANALYSIS
125fc69700de41e6970cc84111e17ab1,12623,12810,These are questions which do not really fall for decision in the present appeal which is confined to interpreting the true nature and scope of el b of sub s 2 of s 10 of the Act ,ANALYSIS
7dab038ba121469593c5bddbf4f1d94e,12811,12994,With regard to the corresponding provision in sub s 3 of s 23 of the Indian Income tax Act there is a decision of thisCourt which in our opinion answers the question before us ,ANALYSIS
f536137b57e04c4993be02623e2836c5,12994,13094, The decision is that of Dhakeswari Cotton Mills Ltd v Commissioner of Income Tax West Bengal 1 ,PRE_RELIED
ce28daea06a243928bd074fe24972e83,13095,13682,This Court observed As regards the second contention we are in entire agreement with the learned Solicitor General when he says that the Income tax Officer is not fettered by technical rules of evidence and pleadings and that he is entitled to act on material which may not be accepted as evidence in a Court of law but there the agreement ends because it is equally clear that in making the assessment under sub s 3 of s 23 of the Act the Income tax Officer is not entitled to make a pure guess and make an assessment without reference to any evidence or any material at all ,PRE_RELIED
274fc91a46a54a71b39bb8896e312ee0,13683,13774,There must be something more than bare suspicion to support the assessment under s 23 3 ,PRE_RELIED
094e2cba9e5e44528e377f3a7ff3b5f0,13774,13906, In our view the aforesaid observations clearly show that the High Court was in error in answering the question in the affirmative ,ANALYSIS
d84048ff6a794147823e99e3b952ba4a,13907,14136,Firstly the High Court treated the question referred to it as a pure question of fact if that were so then the High Court should have rejected the reference on the ground that it was not competent to answer a question of fact ,ANALYSIS
4478cd95df4e4d97b5b976fe78713c39,14137,14412,Then the High Court proceeded to consider certain decisions relating to the interpretation of sub ss 3 and 4 of s 23 of the Indian Income tax Act and held that there was no difference between an assessment under sub s 3 and an assessment under sub s 4 of s 23 ,ANALYSIS
755ea04b71744f2387ba3e20e8c1301d,14413,14669,The High Court applied the same analogy and on that footing held that there being no difference between an assessment under cl b of sub s 2 and an assessment under sub s 4 of s 10 of the Act the answer to the question must be in the affirmative ,ANALYSIS
e708df10e5614ee3a35c9551da5d3c9d,14670,14892,In our view the approach of the High Court to the question referred to it was erroneous and the answer given to the question by it solely on the basis of sub s 4 of s 10 of the Act was vitiated by that wrong approach ,ANALYSIS
29cb295e8a7d43debff291e7c1510734,14892,15063, It was not sub s 4 of s 10 of the Act which the High Court had to consider it had to consider the true scope and effect of cl b of sub s 2 of s 10 of the Act ,ANALYSIS
28414a19363440bf8ea88f3a7a934d66,15063,15209, 1 1955 1 S C R 941 949 Learned counsel for the respondent has strongly urged two points in support of the answer which the High Court gave ,ARG_RESPONDENT
34a221dad5d74dfc83d120f7bb65ae75,15209,15630, Firstly he has contended that on a proper reading of the assessment orders and the orders of the Commissioner it would appear that the gross turnover for the quarters in question was based on certain materials therefore the argument of learned counsel is that it is not correct to say that the figure of gross turnover was arbitrarily adopted or was adopted without reference to any evidence or any material at all ,ARG_RESPONDENT
c3bf69e1c8514a388f924fb524616642,15631,15728,We have examined the assessment orders in question which form part of the statement of the case ,ARG_RESPONDENT
fbb2801662ad424ea920a2475cf76f9d,15729,15945,It is clear to us that what the Sales Tax Officer and the Commissioner did was to hold for certain reasons that the returns made by the assessee and the books of account filed by it were incorrect and undependable ,ANALYSIS
121e4aa2fa0247a5b16dbe4a376c196a,15946,16136,It is not necessary to repeat those reasons because we must accept the finding of fact arrived at by the assessing authorities that the returns and the books of account were not dependable ,ANALYSIS
a45437b05ebd468f831f777b62093721,16137,16573,The assessing authorities rightly pointed out that several transactions were not entered in the books of account and a surprise inspection made on July 15 1947 disclosed certain transactions with a Bombay firm known as Messrs Kishundas Lekhraj which were not mentioned in the books of account and finally the assessee Was importing silver in the name of five confederates in order to suppress the details of the transactions etc ,ANALYSIS
cfd9c369e55c4aa4848ea9bee3552ff1,16574,16870,The assessing authorities further pointed out that there was a discrepancy between the return filed for the quarter ending June 30 1946 and the accounts filed in support of it the return showed a gross turnover of Rs 2 28 370 12 0 while the accounts revealed a gross turnover of Rs 1 48 204 ,ANALYSIS

c210a4f628ce4c5d9170c9ce0a009608,17111,17236,On the contrary they indulged in a pure guess and adopted a figure without reference to any evidence or any material at all ,ANALYSIS

2c8357faf3bd4a17b8aa48d991ebc3c5,17763,18073,These and similar orders do not show that the assessment was made with reference to any evidence or material on the contrary they show that having rejected the books of account the assessing authorities indulged in pure guess and made an assessment without reference to any evidence or any material at all ,ANALYSIS
93f895052d05480abacd98eb71fcdf0d,18074,18177,This the assessing authorities were not entitled to do under cl b of sub s 2 of s 10 of the Act ,ANALYSIS
f7f0f93c35ba4c5ba4c4769f9a3e533b,18177,18452, Secondly learned counsel for the respondent has referred us to several decisions on which the High Court relied and has argued that on the basis of those decisions it must be held that the answer given by the High Court to the question referred to it was a correct answer ,ARG_RESPONDENT
6755fd521d2e4d939114f797166abb26,18453,18651,We propose to examine briefly some of those decisions though as we have stated earlier the question is really answered by the observations made by this Court in Dhakeswari Cotton Mills case 1 ,ANALYSIS
ed061f9d08b94817819aee8b61106aed,18651,18764, The first decision is the Privy Council decision in Income tax Commissioner v Badridas Ramrai Shop Akola 2 ,PRE_RELIED
06aa409cc2de494eacc75d4d09606b9c,18765,19111,Lord Russell of Killowen in delivering the judgment of their Lordships made the following observations as respects a best of judgment assessment within the meaning of s 23 4 of the Indian Income tax Act The officer is to make an assessment to the best of his judgment against a person who is in default as regards supplying information ,PRE_RELIED
c37425023140414f85063da880230cbe,19112,19222,He must not act dishonestly or vindictively or capriciously because he must exercise judgment in the matter ,ANALYSIS
335b2029703b4ce389267ec7df00f5ab,19223,19807,He must make what he honestly believes to be a fair estimate of the proper figure of assessment and for this purpose he must their Lordships think be able to take into consideration local knowledge and repute in regard to the assessee s circumstances and his own knowledge of previous returns by and assessments of the assessee 1 1955 S C R 94I 949 2 1937 64 I A 102 114 115 and all other matters which he thinks will assist him in arriving at a fair and proper estimate and though there must necessarily be guess work in the matter it must be honest guess work ,ANALYSIS
759e461a9be54e49a9df155abca83de6,19808,20208, We find nothing in those observations which runs counter to the observations made in Dhakeswari Cotton Mills case 1 No doubt it is true that when the returns and the books of account are rejected the assessing officer must make an estimate and to that extent he must make a guess but the estimate must be related to some evidence or material and it must be something more than mere suspicion ,PRE_RELIED
7cb02963189c4651bef5d0825f927627,20209,20654,To use the words of Lord Russell of Killowen again he must make what he honestly believes to be a fair estimate of the proper figure of assessment and for this purpose he must take into consideration such materials as the assessing officer has before him including the assessee s circumstances knowledge of previous returns and all other matters which the assessing officer thinks will assist him in arriving at a fair and proper estimate ,ANALYSIS
10dc59ae6f8645289d6d9f24a1dd3aeb,20655,20784,In the case under our consideration the assessing officer did not do so and that is where the grievance of the assessee arises ,ANALYSIS

72e1ed78366140baaf39d2d3a426c24f,20869,21454,It was held therein that where the income tax authorities were not satisfied with the correctness or completeness of the assessees accounts and taking into consideration the state of affairs in general and the fact that the assessees had a large business and the profit shown by them was abnormally low in comparison with that of other persons carrying on the same business in the locality calculated the taxable income by applying a flat rate of 7 per cent the authorities were justified in applying such a flat rate and the burden was on the assessees to displace the estimate ,PRE_RELIED
71b96d0fd4ee4d2e84ee826d3e34e6f8,21455,21583,There again the estimate made was not a pure guess and was based on some materials which the Income tax Officer had before him ,PRE_RELIED
1e4c561c43d44a0bbbd4dacedf270c3b,21584,21949,Din Mohammad J who gave the leading judgment observed It cannot be denied that there must be some material before the Income tax Officer on which 1 1955 1 S C R 941 949 2 1937 5 I T R 464 to base his estimate but no hard and fast rule can be laid down by the Court to define what sort of material is required on which his estimate can be founded ,PRE_RELIED

489dcfc639b24c318d171f3bf3465d74,21992,22406,If in this case the Sales Tax authorities had based their estimate on some material before them no objection could have been taken but the question which was referred to the High Court and which arose out of the orders of assessment was whether it was open to the said authorities to make an assessment on a figure of gross turnover without referring to any materials to justify the adoption of that figure ,ANALYSIS
eadd55bfa0364d5ca97c541f73946b5c,22407,22645,In answering that question in the affirmative the High Court has given a carte blanche to the Sales Tax authorities and has in our opinion misdirected itself as to the true scope and effect of cl b of sub s 2 of s 10 of the Act ,ANALYSIS

f3a844e31be84a32bb63e17b4d476c9c,2339,2619, 3 Learned Counsel for the petitioner invites the attention of the court to the representation application filed by him on 31 01 2014 before the respondent requesting to issue copy of the sworn statement of one Mr Mukesh Choksi on the basis whereof proceedings were re opened ,ARG_PETITIONER
a19f6c52ea20406694073c2bb7e42d5b,2620,2760,It transpires that a search had been conducted by the income tax authorities at Mumbai on M s Mahasagar Securities and Mukesh Choksi Group ,ARG_PETITIONER
4725fd5ce95f4e5c87fa1f987c5a59ba,2761,3208,At that time Mr Mukesh Choksi had admitted to have made accommodation entries in his books to enable the clients to declare speculation profit loss shorter gains etc and had identified the petitioner herein and certain others as some of the beneficiaries of the fraudulent entries transactions by giving a sworn statement in that regard and it is based on the said sworn statement of Mukesh Choksi respondent has re opened the proceedings ,ARG_PETITIONER
b7602e8b05704fd59da5c64365d5b089,3209,3394,It is in this background petitioner had made a request to the respondent on 31 01 2014 to provide a copy of the sworn statement so that petitioner could take further course of action ,ARG_PETITIONER
11dbbc3b03484ca19abbb672dab68a48,3394,3525, 4 It is not in dispute that petitioner was not furnished with the copy of the statement said to have been made by Mukesh Choksi ,ANALYSIS
340dd24beead4494a6c0c259ba29edb3,3526,3589,Petitioner was not aware of the contents of the said statement ,ANALYSIS
cb7e567b0b4241f186edc8a97f150039,3590,3792,However he filed objections contending inter alia that it was not known how a statement made by third party could be made applicable and made basis for the proceedings that were sought to be initiated ,ANALYSIS
ac3899b6076b4e669e73bcbf6801dd1d,3793,4030,He also points out by way of objection that in the absence of specific allegations made against the petitioner in the so called sworn statement the same could not have been made basis to pass the assessment order against the petitioner ,ANALYSIS
fc3d20e89daa4572b3cf16cc55940a4b,4030,4278, 5 Despite such objections raised respondent has proceeded to pass the impugned order holding that an amount of Rs 5 71 950 which reflected the sale proceeds of shares was required to be brought to tax under the head Other Sources of Income ,ANALYSIS
913f094f294d4b5b9d6a7439dce821b0,4279,4445,It is this amount which according to the findings recorded by the respondent was attributed to the petitioner in the so called sworn statement given by Mukesh Choksi ,ANALYSIS
97a5fc7dcf30431d8fc4bb3fac6c64e4,4445,4821, 6 Thus it is apparent that without furnishing a copy of the statement stated to have been given by Mukesh Choksi and without notifying the petitioner regarding basis of the transaction that petitioner is said to have entered into with Mukesh Choksi respondent has passed the impugned order The entire basis for the impugned order is the sworn statement of Mukesh Choksi ,ANALYSIS
5a5d375d11284a56bfd3a72a2b9af1ca,4822,5030,Unless petitioner is given opportunity to have his say in the mater with regard to the said statement and its contents it cannot be said that petitioner was given an opportunity of being heard in the matter ,ANALYSIS
66fbfc48b7854efca21439db6d3bacaa,5031,5177,Hence it has to be held that the impugned order is passed without providing any fair and reasonable opportunity of being heard to the petitioner ,ANALYSIS
aaff896f05414960be6bec64b5d830c5,5177,5827, 7 In fact learned Counsel for the petitioner places reliance on the judgment of the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court in the case of Mr Ashok Mittal Vs Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax and another in WP C No 1452 2013 wherein also petitioner therein had specifically objected for the assessment proceedings stating that he had no transaction with either Mukesh Choksi or any other related companies but the Assessing Officer had solely proceeded on the basis of the statement and the list provided without there being any other information or details furnished to the petitioner though petitioner therein had sought for such details ,ARG_PETITIONER
b41e8d6698d2419eab6d32c803017277,5828,6047,The High Court of Delhi has held that there was absence of fair and reasonable opportunity and such an assessment order could not be sustained and could be interfered with under Article 226 of the Constitution of India ,ARG_PETITIONER
e4f773c7cf214f72ab03a4ea2d071619,6047,6544, 8 In the light of the facts and circumstances as adverted to above and as the petitioner has been denied an opportunity of fair hearing by providing copy of the statement and related details regarding the alleged share amount I am of the view that the matter requires to be re considered by the respondent by providing fair and reasonable opportunity of hearing to the petitioner and by furnishing the details copy of the statement based on which the impugned assessment order has been passed ,RATIO

d6f5b267bf94473f847abcb1e2872b2f,2566,2781,5 In order to substantiate its case prosecution has examined as many as two witnesses out of whom P W 2 is the SI of Excise P W 1 is the Excise staff who had accompanied P W 2 during the alleged patrolling duty ,FAC
924affb6b295470586398dabb68a14a4,2782,2879,On the other hand the defence has preferred not to examine any witness on behalf of the accused ,FAC
c82af3bc21894efb8a27d322938dfb29,2881,3338,6 In order to establish seizure P W 2 has deposed that on 26 10 1999 at about 05 30 PM while he had been for patrolling duty with his staff at Singh basti Brahamanitrang area on receipt of reliable information he conducted raid in the house of the accused and after observing all legal formalities of search he searched the house of the accused and recovered one earthen steel head with liquor smell and one earthen pot containing some liquid substance ,FAC

4050387641824089899b046bb891ce50,3778,3935,The SI of Excise also drew sample for the purpose of chemical examination and destroyed the rest of the seized articles at the spot in presence of witnesses ,FAC
5fbb85f088df44ddbdb96c37a0256d26,3936,3994,P W 1 has also deposed in the same light as that of P W 2 ,FAC
55f14886557141069bfed7be28f4ef15,3994,4110, During the course of cross examination of P W 2 had admitted that the seized sample was not produced in the court ,FAC
deb064dfba1c41838479cd3ed65a34d5,4111,4302,It appears from the evidence adduced that though the spot of seizure was the house of the accused but no independent witness has been examined by the prosecution to prove the fact of seizure ,ANALYSIS
1fb89a684c5a43e6b308b7776d242e0c,4303,4422,In the absence of independent corroboration to the evidence of the Excise personnel the prosecution case is suspicious ,ANALYSIS
debb407392c5480f9c724b056d27d3c5,4423,4534,Prosecution has also not adduced any evidence that the accused had dominion or control over the seized article ,ANALYSIS
2c3e35a41b2343bf95089e660bb88969,4535,4691,In view of the above discussion the fact that the seized article was recovered from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused becomes doubtful ,ANALYSIS
139b630653b14a9db2aac3e486efedb4,4691,4866, Hence it is concluded that prosecution has failed to prove the factum of seizure from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused beyond all the reasonable doubts ,ANALYSIS
1ea10fce4dd4430baf2a3bdb9ecf040c,4867,5052,7 So far as the nature of liquor is concerned though P W 2 has deposed that he tested the contents of the earthen pot with the help of blue litmus paper and such paper turned into red ,ANALYSIS
7726313548a64d59893492f240a3f54a,5053,5173,But during course of cross examination he had admitted that he has not affixed the said litmus paper in the case record ,ANALYSIS
4827cbcb1d5749cb9016cf9f5d6e0376,5173,5434, Similarly though in his examination in chief P W 2 has deposed that he drew sample from the seized article for the purpose of chemical examination but during course of his cross examination he has stated that the sample was not sent for chemical examination ,ANALYSIS
856c900a7b314a7cbce73c4cc399c00d,5435,5518,He has also admitted that he has not filed his experience certificate in the court ,ANALYSIS
4c3d4dd68db3462091d257c5e5e55143,5519,5587,Law is well settled that chemical test is the surest test of liquor ,ANALYSIS
6392d5c529a54e9bafb8b26e2c1c57ef,5588,5915,Where chemical test has not been done and other tests like blue litmus paper and hydrometer test etc has been done the burden lies on the prosecution to establish that the officer is specially trained and has long departmental experience so that his evidence can be accepted as expert opinion and can substitute chemical test ,ANALYSIS
17c731a993d740618c24972aa446a191,5916,6066,In absence of any chemical test so also any document to prove that the S I can be regarded as expert it is not safe to rely on the testimony of P W2 ,ANALYSIS
7c98448db97f4e5d8720229615141f3a,6067,6193,In view of the above discussion the allegation that the seized article is nothing but fermented mahua wash comes under cloud ,ANALYSIS
b134bdc685864731a53ba38d2419d13b,6194,6342,Hence it can be safely concluded that prosecution has failed to prove that the seized article is fermented mahua wash beyond all reasonable doubts ,ANALYSIS
ddfec7e947da483d9ff01d6366efa668,6343,6534,08 In the present case after analyzing the evidence on record I find it fair enough to acquit the accused on the ground that prosecution has miserably failed to prove the occurrence itself ,RATIO
65e2ec8fb8db40cfad33e8a6e402df29,6536,6711,In the result I hold the accused not guilty of offence u s 47 f of Bihar and Orissa Excise Act and he is acquitted therefrom as per the provision of section 248 1 of Cr P C ,RPC

145206a2e5c940e5b3e0e30cbe19caaa,8190,8457,After hearing the learned Counsel for the rival parties and the learned Advocate General we framed the following two questions on 09012015 in the light of the above facts and in view of submissions made before us in order to concentrate on the legal issues involved ,ISSUE
e270639ed87d494fb568fad5529c064f,8457,9562, Two questions 1 In the wake of Section 11 2 read with Section 12 of the Maharashtra Scheduled Castes Scheduled Tribes De Notified Tribes Vimukta Jatis Nomadic Tribes Other Backward Classes and Special Backward Category Regulation of Issuance and Verification of Caste Certificate Act 2000 whether the Police Station Officer acting under Section 154 of the Code of Criminal Procedure can register an offence under Section 12 of the Act when Section 11 2 contemplates filing of a private complaint by Scrutiny Committee or its authorised officer 2 Whether a caste certificate obtained before 23rd May 2001 i e prior to coming into force of Maharashtra Scheduled Castes Scheduled Tribes DeNotified Tribes Vimukta Jatis Nomadic Tribes Other Backward Classes and Special Backward Category Regulation of Issuance and Verification of Caste Certificate Act 2000 if found to be false or obtained by any other fraudulent means could attract the offence under Section 11 or under Section 13 of the Act which makes issuance of false caste certificate punishable ,ISSUE

c4944f71809d44a8addae779db638d18,9576,9862, In support of the applications Shri R S Parsodkar the learned Counsel for the applicants submitted that the caste certificates in favour of the applicants in all these cases were issued by the competent authority admittedly before 23052001 i e when the Act of 2000 came into force ,ARG_PETITIONER
5c731bc56769480d91a4fc700d0b31be,9863,10222,When the caste certificates were issued the provisions regarding law as to the criminal offences under Sections 10 1 11 12 or 13 did not exist because the Act of 2000 itself came into force with effect from 23052001 and therefore no criminal offences could be alleged either against the applicants or the competent authority issuing the caste certificates ,ARG_PETITIONER
6d9d35c5f4fc479f90dba2e2461ab8d2,10223,10569,Shri R S Parsodkar the learned Counsel then argued that the practice adopted by the Scrutiny Committee after invalidating the claim of the candidates for Scheduled Tribes is to direct its officer to file F I R with the Police Station under the above provisions of the Act of 2000 merely because the caste claim is not proved by the candidates ,ARG_PETITIONER
90e8d40b632f463e91f5974f33572c26,10569,10955, According to him failure to prove the caste claim for want of evidence or for any other reason would not automatically constitute offence under the Act of 2000 and in these cases the Committee has not recorded any finding about obtaining any false certificate or by fraudulent means nor that the competent authority issuing certificate did so fraudulently or with criminal intention ,ARG_PETITIONER
beb30527f1ea455da950605e616456ba,10956,11243,Shri R S Parsodkar the learned Counsel then argued that at any rate the caste certificate issued by the competent authority before coming into force of the Act of 2000 even if it is found to be wrong Section 13 is not attracted as the said section cannot have retrospective operation ,ARG_PETITIONER
3ddadb44398f42499097ec84cffdd5c6,11244,11482,The learned Counsel for the applicants then argued that though the offences have been made nonbailable and cognizable but looking to the language of Section 11 2 what is contemplated is a private complaint case and not the police case ,ARG_PETITIONER
dd08e182f52b48fd852e942166db12a1,11483,11596,The Counsel for the applicants therefore prayed for quashing of F I R and the criminal cases filed against them ,ARG_PETITIONER

3d9823c2912c4bd78721b37394489c11,850,1365, 2 The brief facts leading to the instant appeal are that an FIR was lodged against the Appellant Raju s o Rajendar Singh and two other persons viz Raju s o Bhim and Raja Raj Kumar s o Makhsi alleging that the three persons had intercepted the prosecutrix when she was passing by some fields along with her oneyearold brother and had taken her to a field nearby whereupon Raju s o Bhim and Raja Raj Kumar s o Makhsi engaged in the gangrape of the prosecutrix while the Appellant stood outside the field ,FAC
a4b495446fd946d1acaacaf67e7927b0,1366,1463,The prosecutrix was aged fifteen years at the time of the incident which occurred on 14 09 2000 ,FAC
6f23bd8f75f04684a039a34a425875c8,1464,1709,The three accused were convicted for the offence punishable under Section 376 2 g of the IPC and sentenced to 10 years rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 500 and further two months rigorous imprisonment in default of payment of fine ,RLC
265b2579ce1b47089d5ba6afb26466e9,1710,1778,Aggrieved by the same the three accused appealed to the High Court ,FAC
0f6696b322ca4020a482c244ec3ffce9,1779,2096,3 The Appellant inter alia raised the defence before the High Court that he was aged less than 18 years at the time of commission of the offence i e 14 09 2000 and hence was entitled to the benefit of the provisions of the Juvenile Justice Care and Protection of Children Act 2000 in short the 2000 Act ,FAC
5006b33dec52452e8ee2f0f0c12a965d,2097,2221,The High Court however rejected such contention and affirmed the conviction of the three accused including the Appellant ,RLC
a93dbb3cefef45c790dd543005af9168,2222,2346,4 Aggrieved by the above judgment the Appellant filed the instant appeal inter alia raising the plea of juvenility again ,FAC
df7f5e4a2b244a0ba16bc856e1c4e534,2347,2511,The Appellant relied upon a transfer certificate issued in his favour by the Dayanand Middle School Sohna Gurgaon which showed his date of birth to be 12 07 1984 ,FAC
f2632548e99d469e9b001df41131bdd6,2512,2655,He also relied upon a certificate issued by the Government Senior Secondary School Boys Sohna which showed his date of birth to be the same ,FAC
c9e6bae0539d48ffa04b618be862d1ec,2656,2841,It was submitted by the Appellant before this Court that the certificates in question prima facie entitled him to claim the conduct of an inquiry in terms of Section 7A of the 2000 Act ,FAC
e4c8d7fc396548469af65483dc41f428,2842,3077,The Appellant referred to the decisions of this Court in Murari Thakur v State of Bihar 2009 16 SCC 256 Dharambir v State NCT of Delhi 2010 5 SCC 344 and Jitendra Singh Babboo Singh v State of U P 2010 13 SCC 523 5 ,FAC
daaba440211b49368611c1b5ff77c638,3078,3444,Keeping in mind such circumstances and the certificates relied upon this Court vide order dated 09 08 2012 directed the Registrar Judicial of this Court to conduct an inquiry in respect of the age of the Appellant in terms of Section 7A of the 2000 Act read with the rules framed thereunder and to submit a report to this Court within four months from the order ,FAC
7b27c8d2bad9471a8ea2cd999842aaa0,3445,3662,6 This Court received such report on 07 01 2013 which determined that the age of the Appellant was 16 years 2 months and 2 days at the time of commission of the offence and that he was thus a juvenile at that time ,FAC
c021ed28fa544f7f96073adcdc5245cc,3663,3719,Thereafter arguments were heard and judgement reserved ,FAC
7d9d5a93f78e435b951adc23c99aedf7,3720,3955,However subsequently the State raised the argument that the Court had not looked into the question of whether the plea of juvenility as decided by the Registry of this Court should be given precedence over the view of the High Court ,FAC
024684628f0643e49de796462a33e315,3956,4039,By an order dated 25 04 2014 this Court directed that the appeal be heard further ,FAC
8e2ca0a96ab540b9a94af4aa019c8977,4040,4125,Shri Siddhartha Dave was subsequently appointed as amicus curiae to assist the Court ,FAC
d13de053836d4b278d9f96772bc23aa4,4126,4475,7 It was submitted by the learned amicus curiae that the learned Registrar Judicial of this Court had after duly calling for records and appreciating the material adduced reached the conclusion that the Appellant was a juvenile at the time of commission of the offence and there was no reason to deny the Appellant the benefit of such finding ,FAC
7201c8c9ae7f434b9fb641a802c4a2bc,4476,4839,Moreover he submitted that seeing that it was upon the direction of this Court that the learned Registrar had conducted the inquiry under Section 7A of the 2000 Act and the rules framed thereunder and had submitted his report to this Court after conducting such inquiry in accordance with law the report may be treated as having been made by this Court itself ,FAC

028316a26db346269c7891fb435adb3e,4937,5499, 9 It is by now wellsettled as was held in Hari Ram v State of Rajasthan 2009 13 SCC 211 that in light of Sections 2 k 2 l 7A read with Section 20 of the 2000 Act as amended in 2006 a juvenile who had not completed eighteen years on the date of commission of the offence is entitled to the benefit of the 2000 Act also see Mohan Mali v State of Madhya Pradesh 2010 6 SCC 669 Daya Nand v State of Haryana 2011 2 SCC 224 Dharambir v State NCT of Delhi supra Jitendra Singh Babboo Singh v State of Uttar Pradesh 2013 11 SCC 193 ,PRE_RELIED
9fd73e838d66435dbf7d25db7c1cffc8,5500,5938,It is equally wellsettled that the claim of juvenility can be raised at any stage before any Court by an accused including this Court even after the final disposal of a case in terms of Section 7A of the 2000 Act see Dharambir v State NCT of Delhi supra Abuzar Hossain v State of West Bengal 2012 10 SCC 489 Jitendra Singh Babboo Singh v State of UP supra Abdul Razzaq v State of Uttar Pradesh 2015 15 SCC 637 ,PRE_RELIED
bd334654cb5b41f9a448ed95e5fc3b66,5939,6150,10 In light of the above legal position it is evident that the Appellant would be entitled to the benefit of the 2000 Act if his age is determined to be below 18 years on the date of commission of the offence ,ANALYSIS
0b0fed673bce4d99886a5bae32e21080,6151,6274,Moreover it would be irrelevant that the plea of juvenility was not raised before the Trial Court in light of Section 7A ,ANALYSIS
b8ea351f8e614efda6c6b0617e861dbb,6275,6456,As per the report of the inquiry conducted by the Registrar Judicial of this Court in this case the Appellant was below 18 years of age on the date of commission of the offence ,ANALYSIS
83911f288a974462899b1debd1723032,6457,6674,The only question before us that needs to be determined is whether such report may be given precedence over the contrary view taken by the High Court so that the benefit of the 2000 Act may be given to the Appellant ,ISSUE
c7f0dc67f6e446c5bb9449d0c87acf53,6675,6963,11 Before proceeding further it would be useful to refer to Section 7A of the 2000 Act and Rule 12 of the Juvenile Justice Care and Protection of Children Rules 2007 in short the 2007 Rules which deal with the making of an inquiry by the Court in case of a claim of juvenility ,ANALYSIS
303e6d55187d41ccaeb2331333ea148d,6964,8135,Section 7A of the 2000 Act is as follows 7A Procedure to be followed when claim of juvenility is raised before any court 1 Whenever a claim of juvenility is raised before any court or a court is of the opinion that an accused person was a juvenile on the date of commission of the offence the court shall make an inquiry take such evidence as may be necessary but not an affidavit so as to determine the age of such person and shall record a finding whether the person is a juvenile or a child or not stating his age as nearly as may be Provided that a claim of juvenility may be raised before any court and it shall be recognised at any stage even after final disposal of the case and such claim shall be determined in terms of the provisions contained in this Act and the rules made thereunder even if the juvenile has ceased to be so on or before the date of commencement of this Act 2 If the court finds a person to be a juvenile on the date of commission of the offence under subsection 1 it shall forward the juvenile to the Board for passing appropriate orders and the sentence if any passed by a court shall be deemed to have no effect ,STA

f12d746808814b34bdd0984a4721a1ee,8161,9014,Subrule 3 of Rule 12 of the 2007 Rules states the following regarding the procedure to be followed for age determination In every case concerning a child or juvenile in conflict with law the age determination inquiry shall be conducted by the court or the Board or as the case may be the Committee by seeking evidence by obtaining a i the matriculation or equivalent certificates if available and in the absence whereof ii the date of birth certificate from the school other than a play school first attended and in the absence whereof iii the birth certificate given by a corporation or a municipal authority or a panchayat b and only in the absence of either i ii or iii of clause a above the medical opinion will be sought from a duly constituted Medical Board which will declare the age of the juvenile or child ,STA

ad859a4c6697429c8cef6e01d09755fa,9748,10066,It is evident from a perusal of the above that if any Court including this Court is of the opinion that an accused person was a juvenile on the date of commission of the offence or if a claim of juvenility is raised before it the Court must conduct an inquiry regarding the determination of the age of the accused ,ANALYSIS
802e79fe5c74485885e62427432b3b18,10067,10288,The evidence collected by way of such inquiry as is specified in clauses a i ii and iii of Rule 12 3 or in the absence whereof clause b of the same is treated as conclusive proof of the age of the accused ,ANALYSIS
3821c6850cc947bdbe45b83182d76de6,10289,10461,In such a situation it would be clear that such an inquiry conducted by this Court would be given precedence over a view of the age of the accused taken by the High Court ,ANALYSIS
5a17fb74272f44c28bd400212246cff2,10462,10757,It is relevant to note here itself that in this case the High Court decided the issue merely upon an assessment of the material on record without resorting to the procedure governing inquiries for the determination of age as laid out in Section 7A of the 2000 Act and Rule 12 of the 2007 Rules ,ANALYSIS
99a3fe0597564a74a381a3c1e2bc724b,10757,10994, 14 At this point it is necessary to briefly discuss the findings of the High Court in the impugned judgment regarding the age of the accused to underscore that it has not conducted the inquiry stipulated as per Section 7A and Rule 12 ,ANALYSIS
7dfe0ef845214a4baeb9d8083d29c868,10995,11207,Before the High Court the Appellant submitted a report of the Assistant Commissioner of Police Bhondsi Gurgaon to the effect that his date of birth was 12 07 1984 thereby claiming the benefit of the 2000 Act ,ANALYSIS
f573de8efcaa49638a3c7ab9b86dee11,11208,11925,This plea was rejected on the grounds of failure to raise the plea of juvenility before the Trial court nonproduction of birth certificate in spite of an opportunity being granted to do so absence of the Appellant s name in the birth register dated 12 07 1984 and for the years 198384 and 198485 noncorroboration of the date of birth certificates issued by schools attended by the Appellant through other documentary evidence nonmatching of the name on such certificates Raj Kumar with the name of the Appellant as brought on record Raju and noncorroboration of the address of the Appellant through such certificates which simply stated that the date of birth of the student named Raj Kumar was 12 07 1984 ,ANALYSIS
415813298018406ab96ab4fb3b2bbce6,11925,12161, 15 The High Court evidently did not even frame its discussion in terms of whether the evidence brought on record was sufficient to conduct an inquiry under the 2000 Act and the 2007 Rules let alone order and conduct such an inquiry ,ANALYSIS
7ee539872ffe45b286c698a68ac93484,12162,12381,On the contrary it simply recorded that the evidence did not go to show that the Appellant was a juvenile at the time of the commission of the offence and proceeded to affirm the conviction of the Appellant on merits ,ANALYSIS
97a928da4b644c77be73fc95c04b3eab,12381,12760, 16 Therefore it is evident that the only inquiry as stipulated under the 2000 Act and the 2007 Rules was conducted by the Registrar Judicial upon the directions of this Court after the Court was satisfied upon going through the school certificates adduced by the Appellant that the certificates in question prima facie entitled him to claim the conduct of such an inquiry ,ANALYSIS
dd0de97ac1fe4193a6641503187ea6f5,12761,13167,In such a situation the question regarding whether precedence may be given to the inquiry of a Registrar Judicial of this Court over the opinion of the High Court regarding the age of an accused can be restated as whether such inquiry conducted by the Registrar Judicial upon the direction of this Court if thereafter affirmed by this Court would amount to an inquiry conducted by this Court itself ,ANALYSIS
4f4c86d7a8874c30a81a4abb1416e943,13168,13315,If this be the case the findings of such inquiry would prevail over the view taken by the High Court as is evident from the preceding discussion ,ANALYSIS
2444d1afc8a24cdcadd28f79d8b9ffba,13316,13402,17 We are of the opinion that the above question must be answered in the affirmative ,ANALYSIS
da78e5e903424156a09555eda39ae6b7,13403,13682,This Court on previous occasions as well has adopted the practice of directing the Registrar Judicial to conduct the inquiry in terms of Rule 12 of the 2007 Rules on behalf of this Court and accepted the findings made therein see Dharambir v State NCT of Delhi supra ,ANALYSIS
78c8707ae2a143b19d6e1c318f4f7f35,13683,14004,Seeing that the Registrar Judicial is a District Judge serving on deputation at the Supreme Court recourse to his or her assistance in the form of collecting evidence and arriving at a finding regarding the claim of juvenility of the person concerned may be undertaken by this Court in order to save its judicial time ,ANALYSIS
c0d4e5a249144a17b48c167baa4207e0,14005,14174,However it must be stressed that the findings in an inquiry conducted by the Registrar Judicial would not per se prevail upon a contrary view taken by the High Court ,ANALYSIS
7fb15c49e2274ffd8d7872c9d5891bc7,14175,14531,Only after this Court applies its judicial mind to such report with due regard to the confines of the procedure stipulated in Section 7A of the 2000 Act and Rule 12 of the 2007 Rules and only if it thereafter confirms the findings in such report would the same prevail upon a contrary view taken by the High Court which is not based upon any such inquiry ,ANALYSIS
3c5f2868f66242058b6775e39565717f,14532,14634,18 We may now undertake to consider the findings in the report submitted by the Registrar Judicial ,ANALYSIS
9ae2081b48ab4c8e9632d3a8d24c292e,14635,14812,As already noted as per the report the age of the Appellant was 16 years 2 months and 2 days at the time of commission of the offence and he was thus a juvenile at that time ,ANALYSIS
6b46c80e363b493a96314058f11f778e,14813,15108,In the said report the learned Registrar referred to the original Transfer Certificate in Hindi issued by the Headmaster Dayanand Arya Middle School Sohna dated 24 03 2012 and the Transfer Certificate issued by the Principal Government Senior Secondary School Boys Sohna dated 12 12 2000 ,ANALYSIS
e2eb939d581b4051ac67c621a9fa7aa7,15109,15344,These certificates contain the official seal of the respective schools and the signatures of the respective authorities and state the name of the student as Raj Kumar son of Rajendar Singh and record his date of birth as 12 07 1984 ,ANALYSIS

649a2974bea64186aef66f1dfd182aa2,15829,16128,With respect to the Dayanand Arya Middle School Sohna the learned Registrar examined Mr Suresh Chand Teacher appearing under the directions of the School Headmaster who confirmed that the Transfer Certificate dated 24 03 2012 was bona fide and issued under the signature of the then Principal ,ANALYSIS
2da8234e1f814472bc3bab345cb82722,16129,16285,The Registrar also verified the certificate by comparing it with the office copy of the same in the School Leaving Certificate Register produced before him ,ANALYSIS
2857f42d3c7a456fb22c0584cb7f4fce,16286,16545,The original Admission and Withdrawal Register of the school was also examined which also recorded the Appellant s date of birth as 12 07 1984 and stated that he was admitted in the school on 23 07 1992 and withdrew on 310 3 1996 after passing Class V 20 ,ANALYSIS

fd8fbf949c0f42648d40e8b91d99a42e,17646,18126,The learned Registrar concluded that the school transfer certificates dated 24 03 2012 and 12 12 2000 read along with the relevant entries of school registers of the respective schools were admissible as evidence under Rule 12 3 a ii of the 2007 Rules i e they were found to be in the nature of the date of birth certificate from the school other than a play school first attended as specified in the said clause and thus accepted the Appellant s claim of juvenility ,ANALYSIS
7fd04644ae784f1cbe901c37df6692d7,18127,18259,It was also found that the certificates contained the name of the Appellant as Raj Kumar son of Rajendar Singh born on 12 07 1984 ,ANALYSIS
fbb1805e7f304142b7c8f06c041d3944,18260,18447,This name was found to be the full name of the Appellant and the name Raju appearing on the SLP record taken to be an alias as affirmed by both his parents by way of separate affidavits ,ANALYSIS
6954cce3409d476b857204439e7db5a9,18448,18611,22 In our opinion the learned Registrar has duly affirmed the veracity and bona fide nature of the certificates adduced by the schools attended by the Appellant ,ANALYSIS
a240a41b3c2246c2b3dffaf146f45eea,18612,19116,At the same time since Rule 12 3 a ii specifically mentions that the certificate showing the date of birth of the person shall be from the school first attended other than a play school we find that the certificate issued and school records maintained by the Dayanand Arya Middle School Sohna where the Appellant studied for four years till class V as duly affirmed through the examination of a witness from such school is sufficient to satisfy the requirement of clause a ii of Rule 12 3 ,ANALYSIS
6eabad0b047c43128f76239cbb0ceec1,19117,19351,Of course it goes without saying that the certificate issued by the Government Senior Secondary School Boys Sohna and the accompanying school records serve to corroborate the veracity of the records furnished by the former school ,ANALYSIS

cb35d44a9f294bc3b3102ff80f7aa0d5,19485,19678,23 We are also conscious of the limitation envisaged under Section 7A of the 2000 Act that the evidence adduced with respect to the age of the accused cannot be in the form of mere affidavits ,ANALYSIS
b8e021417810404596774edc2d204aec,19679,19936,Due to this reason the reliance of the learned Registrar upon affidavits to conclude that the name used in the certificates placed on record i e Raj Kumar is the full name of the Appellant and the name Raju is merely an alias is not tenable in our view ,ANALYSIS
a5350d71aaa840a38323b3cd54d64a69,19937,20258,However we find that there is sufficient evidence on record in the form of the appearance of the name of the father of the Appellant on the certificate dated 24 03 2012 issued by the Dayanand Arya Middle School Sohna to indicate that the name Raj Kumar appearing on such certificate was the full name of the Appellant ,ANALYSIS
8f04a2ebbbed40ccb2864d4e9f31c348,20258,20529, 24 In light of the above discussion we are of the opinion that it has been conclusively established that the date of birth of the Appellant was 12 07 1984 and as such he was aged 16 years 2 months and 2 days at the time of commission of the offence dated 14 09 2000 ,RATIO
0ea048d6aa244b8fa507f368474d1026,20530,20838,In such circumstances we do not have any doubt that the inquiry conducted by the Registrar Judicial upon the direction of this Court in the instant matter amounts to an inquiry conducted by this Court itself and is conclusive proof of the age of the Appellant as provided in Rule 12 3 of the 2007 Rules ,RATIO
8c6fd603c2074ebf850b9e618cbecc87,20839,21011,As the Appellant satisfies the requirement of Sections 2 k and 2 l of the 2000 Act the said Act is applicable to him in full force in light of Section 7A and Section 20 ,RATIO
82a7fb5389554076b8c06c35033c67be,21011,21189, 25 Criminal Appeal hereby stands allowed and the order of the High Court affirming the conviction and sentence of the Appellant under Section 376 2 g of the IPC is set aside ,RPC
4c4bcd466d874a2b976a4ee3e391876c,21190,21540,Seeing that the Appellant has already spent 6 years in imprisonment whereas the maximum period for which a juvenile may be sent to a special home is only 3 years as per Section 15 1 g of the 2000 Act and since the Appellant has already been enlarged on bail by virtue of the order of the Court dated 09 05 2014 he need not be taken into custody ,RPC
8c1de657a638479fb4c951dddf6df62b,21541,21666,His bail bonds stand discharged and all proceedings against him so far as they relate to the present case stand terminated ,RPC

44662814a20445bf913cd7bba3085ef9,3699,3943,However when it was held that lottery tickets are not goods the sales tax imposed on lottery tickets was withdrawn by the State Government and the Maharashtra Tax on Lotteries Act 2006 hereinafter referred to as the State Act was enacted ,FAC
89cd226777c140f2a2650a9593d04c51,3943,4277, 3 It is the contention of the petitioners that the legislature of State of Maharashtra has no legislative power to enact Laws relating to State Lotteries including Laws relating to taxation and therefore according to the petitioners the State Act is beyond the legislative competence of the legislature of State of Maharashtra ,ARG_PETITIONER
3b4ded60e87b4f918bba2f6d5219a6ec,4278,4454,The second submission is that the enactment of the State Act is colourable exercise of the legislative power inasmuch as it is another method of levying tax on lottery tickets ,ARG_PETITIONER
c42326ec78aa41a4b43e9e42e7098c67,4455,4662,The third submission is that the State Act seeks to levy tax on lottery schemes tax is collected in advance in respect of each draw in the lottery scheme at the rate specified in Section 3 of the State Act ,ARG_PETITIONER
ecbc7c74e0974a03b80cf40c71769c8b,4663,4895,It is submitted that lottery scheme of all other State organizing and conducting lotteries save and except that of Maharashtra are formulated outside the State of Maharashtra and therefore the Law has extra territorial application ,ARG_PETITIONER
10f2abc35e284404b18090771ba41825,4896,5112,The fourth submission is that the State Act levies tax on lottery schemes but the term lottery scheme is not defined anywhere and therefore it is violative of guarantee under Article 14 of the Constitution of India ,ARG_PETITIONER
944d364b5a404001875e558d871750e1,5113,5454,It was also contended that the State Act has been enacted to impose tax on sale of lottery tickets conducted by other States in State of Maharashtra so as to make selling of lottery tickets by the other States uneconomical unviable and thereby creating monopoly in the lottery tickets of the lotteries conducted by the State of Maharashtra ,ARG_PETITIONER
d9bd7128ef1c4f42aa00c204207c0b67,5454,5651, 4 Elaborating the first submission the learned Counsel appearing for petitioners submitted that the legislature of State of Maharashtra has no legislative competence to enact the impugned Act ,ARG_PETITIONER
e6242c802fd443fcb58eb67c6ca81e5b,5652,5724, By the impugned Act tax is sought to be levied on the lottery schemes ,ARG_PETITIONER
1c29132f35864388944d815c6e7f718c,5725,6084,The subject Lotteries organised by the Government of India or the Government of a State comes in Entry 40 of List I in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India and therefore only Parliament is empowered to enact Law relating to lotteries governed by Government of India or the Government of a State or any law relating to such tax on the lotteries ,ARG_PETITIONER
c5bffbca8cd34932866ae094374524c8,6085,6261,It is submitted that the State legislature does not have competence to levy tax on the lotteries under Entry 62 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India ,ARG_PETITIONER
ca677d2ffe5b450b8383aa4565893253,6262,6874,The learned Counsel relied on the judgments of the Supreme Court in the cases H Anraj others Vs State of Maharashtra AIR 1984 2 Supreme Court 781 and H Anraj others Vs Government of Tamilnadu AIR 1986 Supreme Court 63 and it was submitted that the lotteries organized by the State are necessarily excluded from betting and gambling mentioned in Entry 62 of List II of the Seventh schedule and then it was contended that the State of Maharashtra has not shown any other source of power except Entry 62 of List II of the Seventh Schedule and therefore the State Act is beyond its legislative competence ,ARG_PETITIONER
5edec7b84b1d4bfaa0b35fffa0ee4ad4,6874,7214, 5 Elaborating the second submission it was submitted that prior to the decision of the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in the case M s Sunrise Associates Vs Govt of NCT of Delhi Ors AIR 2006 Supreme Court 1908 the State of Maharashtra has been collecting tax on State lottery tickets treating lottery tickets as goods ,ARG_PETITIONER
594d4396c2a741d48de756c6ffb02b2f,7215,7412,However once it was held to be unconstitutional as lottery tickets were held not to be the goods now again tax is being collected on sale of lottery tickets under the provisions of the State Act ,ARG_PETITIONER
850459ee654c4515bac0cf9139e6d31f,7412,7537, 6 Elaborating the third submission it was contended that the State Act seeks to levy and collect tax on lottery schemes ,ARG_PETITIONER
b3bbe0f6adba4209b8fc54a16caeba05,7538,7981,It was submitted that the lottery schemes of other States organizing and conducting lotteries save and except that of State of Maharashtra are formulated outside State of Maharashtra and in the respective State organizing and conducting lotteries and the draws in respect of the said schemes are also held in the said States itself and the results are also declared in the said States and published in the official Gazettes of the said States ,ARG_PETITIONER
888e60cb3bbe41b4bf76ae9ea87f4b66,7982,8219,Thus by seeking to charge and collect tax on lottery schemes the State Act seeks to tax events which have occurred outside the State and hence the State Act is dealing with the subject which is not within its territorial jurisdiction ,ARG_PETITIONER
43366c08f7bf4158be35f0a6818aa6e2,8219,8374, 7 Elaborating the fourth submission it was contended that though tax is imposed in relation to the schemes the term Scheme is not defined in the Act ,ARG_PETITIONER
5f7618a7891e4de1990ec31d1a77c690,8375,8567,Thus the tax is being levied with reference to the concept which is extremely vague and therefore levying of tax in such a situation violates the guarantee of Article 14 of the Constitution ,ARG_PETITIONER
749806721bd7407db311efc22adf1aab,8568,8894,It was also submitted that extremely large amount has been collected as tax under the Act with a view to make it uneconomical to sell tickets of lotteries conducted by other States in the State of Maharashtra with a view to create monopoly in relation to the lottery tickets of the lotteries conducted by State of Maharashtra ,ARG_PETITIONER

b4b6d4dca61d4e9aa79cbee7df33afa8,9333,9487,It was contended that considering the constitutional scheme it cannot be said that the State legislature does not have competence to enact the State Act ,ARG_RESPONDENT
6ebde802528848fdb8ec0d997ee326a7,9488,9697,The learned Counsel took us through the provisions of the Act to show that by reading the definition of term lottery it becomes clear that what is the meaning of term scheme used in Section 3 of the State Act ,ARG_RESPONDENT
1ee6a4d3d0fe4278a5f78698ea0faa91,9698,9783,It was pointed out that it cannot be said that there is any vagueness in this matter ,ARG_RESPONDENT
5862d4816aa44700853d2e6e2836f517,9784,9983,It was then submitted that the tax is not being collected on sale of lottery tickets but the tax is collected in relation to the lottery schemes once tickets are imported in the State of Maharashtra ,ARG_RESPONDENT

fa57222dbc7c47b69c58f0bae611294f,18574,19138,It is necessary also to emphasise that the statute provides that once an assessment comes before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner his competence is not restricted to examining those aspects of the assessment which are complained of by the assessee his competence ranges over the whole assessment and it is open to him to correct the Income tax Officer not only with regard to a matter raised by the assessee but also with regard to a matter which has been considered by the 1 31 I T R 909 Income tax Officer and determined in the course of the assessment ,ANALYSIS

2169d44a28784750a5b5831b17e37891,12102,12368, It is pertinent to note that the Tribunal has rejected the claim of the Revenue under the show cause notice dated 29 9 1980 for recovery of excise duty under TI 14 1 ii for the period from November 1978 to April 1979 on the ground that the same is time barred ,ANALYSIS

bd18453a5f3745f98a6876d370eac579,13175,13401,Therefore the contention of the respondents that the demand for recovery under TI 68 for the period from April 1979 to February 1986 is in the light of the decision of the Tribunal dated 31st March 1987 cannot be accepted ,ANALYSIS
0a48ea3b922d44efbcceb93b41371e99,13403,13812,13 In the present case it is not in dispute that in May 1979 the petitioners had filed classification list under protest classifying the Master Batches under TI 14 1 ii as claimed by the revenue and since then the Master Batches have been cleared on payment of duty under TI 14 1 ii and that the assessment in respect of clearances effected during April 1979 to February 1986 have attained finality ,ANALYSIS

a2d486f9c3e24a33b8803b95ae55cdb9,15602,15870,In other words in respect of goods cleared on payment of duty under TI 14 1 ii during 1979 to 1986 the question of the petitioners recovering duty under TI 68 from their customers in the year 1987 in the light of the decision of the Tribunal does not arise at all ,ANALYSIS

d83c040345364564a253ddb74523f539,888,1139,1 In the income tax return filed by the assessee for the assessment year 1997 98 the assessee had shown income received from two sources i e domestic income as well as receipts of consultancy from foreign clients earned as foreign exchange ,FAC
e6505dfc25c645cfbc86037f0028f125,1140,1359,Insofar as latter category of income is concerned the assessee also claimed benefit of Section 80 O of the Income Tax Act namely exemption to the extent of 50 of such receipts from tax as per this provision existing ,FAC
a1d855c51a274535b49ad80a2898edc7,1363,1558,The Assessing Officer while processing the return for assessment noticed that the expenses shown by the assessee in earning the foreign exchange on account of consultancy receipts were much less ,FAC
37a8dadbff244dcd8129ad012881348a,1558,1775, 2 We may note that the assessee had shown consultancy receipts in foreign exchange convertible to Indian Rs 1 11 63 213 and claiming deduction of Rs 48 28 471 under Section 80 O of the Income Tax Act ,FAC
e52197a60abf45c1ba7c1fceaa996cef,1776,1923,The expenses on the foreign income on account of bank charges foreign travelling expenses salaries etc were shown at a figure of Rs 14 37 643 ,FAC
5c73ec088c4e486ea293cc55ab1d85d9,1924,2286, According to the Assessing Officer the expenses stated to have been incurred on the foreign business were much less as compared to the receipts since the exemption under Section 80 O is allowed after deduction of the expenditure over the receipts the Assessing Officer was of the opinion that the expenses incurred are suppressed to claim higher exemption ,FAC
a1d9acf87a3d47fb80f9645d894bcaa2,2297,2508,In these circumstances the Assessing Officer was of the opinion that the entire expenditure incurred whether domestic or foreign earnings should be proportionately apportioned to the foreign earnings as well ,FAC
a26c6cc2b83849b9ba4c386e51d63f63,2508,2818, To arrive at a figure of expenditure to be attributed to foreign earnings he adopted the following formula Total profit from business x Related receipts brought profession into India in convertible foreign exchange total receipts from business profession A 3 ,FAC
bc6ca64c27434f489fb3ea49358f810e,2818,2888,The assessee challenged this order by filing appeal before the CIT A ,FAC
ab97c7d6a9af41478c3194968c940227,2889,3108,The assessee in this appeal itself accepted that some of the expenses incurred in India could be attributed to the foreign receipts and conceded that the assessee will have no objection if such expenses are apportioned ,FAC
4df7dc564dc14cb5b6cfc2192d79d3a9,3109,3326,However the plea of the assessee was that the approach of the Assessing Officer in taking into consideration the total expenditure incurred and apportioning the same by applying the aforesaid formula was not correct ,FAC
5e4755d4fbc14ebea1cbcb38370cfe93,3327,3649,As per the assessee the expenses which were exclusively incurred on domestic business as well as foreign receipts were to be apportioned in entirety respectively and it is only in respect of other expenses which should be treated as common expenses for foreign exchange as well as domestic earning had to be apportioned ,FAC
1ac7c37f9698405782d5de1b8d46ace1,3650,3689,This method was accepted by the CIT A ,FAC
109923c4d02742ebac5a3980c326c13a,3690,3819,The CIT A found that the total expenses incurred by the assessee were Rs 2 09 33 800 and the bifurcation thereof is as under ,RLC

1389a008d8684735a4c03db834ed8251,4865,5013,His submission however was that no detail was given in respect of the Indian projects relocation expenses which were treated as domestic expenses ,ARG_PETITIONER

06dc6e71ac4d41c188e7a3813e1735ca,5171,5471, Secondly if there was any objection to the aforesaid Indian projects relocation expenses or to the justification and genuineness of the Indian projects relocation expenses it was for the Revenue to challenge the same especially in the appeal preferred before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal ,ANALYSIS
4c163915da98499d8d41242db2168fa1,5472,5527,However no such ground was raised before the Tribunal ,ANALYSIS

316bdd79cd1b40f8b34f594f2e55fdb8,5542,6023,We therefore are of the opinion that it is a pure finding of fact recorded by the CIT A which has been accepted by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal ITAT as well since it was un challenged that Indian projects relocation expenses to the tune of Rs 60 08 752 were incurred by the assessee which could be treated exclusively as domestic expenses and were therefore not to be taken into account for apportioning the same between the foreign expenses and domestic expenses ,RATIO

f824fd639f6c4a59902a9e60e907a129,1523,1605, Heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Government Pleader ,NONE
30ca1bf3006c4c6f92acf9116d973cde,1607,1695,2 The petitioner was the accused before the trial court in the following circumstances ,FAC
2738f4df484b410c9ff0f81386540f9a,1696,1949,The complainant alleged that accused no 1 the petitioner herein and she were in love with each other and had decided to marry but before they could marry she was pregnant with a child of the petitioner and she had informed the petitioner of the same ,FAC
753fabe2fced4aa1aace778d4fc473c5,1950,2024,On learning of the pregnancy it is alleged that the petitioner absconded ,FAC
e3dbea6c67854718ba5f794bad000fd1,2024,2195, The complainant claimed that on 16 11 2006 she went to Dwaralu village which was the petitioner s native village and met his parents and inquired about his whereabouts ,FAC
5028e11b0b384461926a9e776673c83a,2196,2275,She also intimated them about the relationship that she and the petitioner had ,FAC
3d5dc84933a74b298ba32823848b7a0a,2276,2422,The parents of the petitioner had advised the complainant that they would secure the presence of their son and would ensure that they are married ,FAC
be1400323f214656a16892714f7ce5eb,2423,2508,In the meantime they requested her not to institute any case against the petitioner ,FAC
bf10b93c1c524ab1a54cecb957efb3cf,2509,2560,With that assurance she had returned to Bangalore ,FAC
06f5d9c54fef47d2b64fb9004a0320e9,2560,2837, 3 It transpires that the petitioner along with an advocate had met the complainant and had expressed that the marriage between the petitioner and the complainant was not possible since they belonged to different castes and that the families may not reconcile to the same ,FAC
452b30f20bdc4ff7b76ad485278eca6b,2837,2982, In this background the complainant had again met accused no 2 the mother of the petitioner and intimated her about the petitioner s attitude ,FAC
a15a2b0cdfc9453f9c928b17026887cd,2983,3080,She was again reassured that the petitioner would be persuaded to marry her but nothing changed ,FAC
07306149b8e54bc3949ac675b87cb603,3081,3177,Therefore the complainant lodged a complaint before the J P Nagar Police Station on 24 11 2006 ,FAC
ad344618c10b44f3af626e8d27edbe44,3178,3380,On 25 11 2006 the petitioner is said to have gone along with the complainant to J P Nagar Police Station and the Police had convinced the petitioner that he had no choice but to marry the complainant ,FAC
2c15acb0fcae4a5bb907ec5d41527ff3,3381,3563,The complainant therefore had claimed that they were married at Ganapathi temple at 4th Block J P Nagar Bangalore and the mother of the petitioner had also attended the marriage ,FAC
9d0010491e8f42d2b560eafa65679985,3565,3791,4 It is her further case that since the petitioner had expressed that he had no money to set up a home she had paid cash of 50 000 and also handed over two bangles in order that he may use the same for setting up a home ,FAC
0e830a37f3f34432b4500402570be9cc,3792,3883,It is her allegation that the petitioner did not do so but misused the amount for himself ,FAC
afd3e10bc2c64bfeb40a22f6dbd92280,3884,4032,Thereafter on 29 12 2006 the complainant is again said to have approached the J P Nagar Police and informed them of the conduct of the petitioner ,FAC
9f93609401a44ac491364b61c37f2833,4033,4268,The presence of the petitioner was again secured on 31 12 2006 and it is claimed that there was reproachment brought about by the Police once again but however the petitioner is said to have deserted the complainant by February 2007 ,FAC
be83947cabba4868b2cf1ee6e11aa181,4269,4374,Therefore the complainant is said to have visited Dwaralu village to meet the parents of the petitioner ,FAC
757f08901af84c1cbbd26c882a7d4c37,4375,4475,But the father of the petitioner had not permitted her to enter their house and had chased her away ,FAC
cd4a5dfdbd914af39558acde6fe9a832,4476,4578,Therefore she had proceeded to the Tavarekere Police Station which refused to receive any complaint ,FAC
91486cc7506b48b1becc9ae01626d91e,4579,4788,Thereafter with the intervention of the Superintendent of Police Tumkur a complaint is said to have been lodged on 9 2 2007 which was forwarded to the jurisdictional Police and a case came to be registered ,FAC
e879775cb57c4cb09102161112ed20bd,4789,4897,Further investigation having been taken up a charge sheet was filed against the petitioner and his parents ,FAC
fa5ab37994244863a43b2b4ba8bf5627,4898,5034,Since the accused pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried the prosecution examined 13 witnesses and marked Exhibits P1 to P24 5 ,FAC
b4477ef853224224985d8fd83036d450,5035,5649,On the basis of the material produced and the allegations made the trial court had framed the following point for consideration 1 Whether the prosecution proves beyond all reasonable doubt that on 2 02 2007 at about 6 00 p m at Dwaralu village accused being the husband of complainant B L Suneetha Accused No 2 and 3 relatives of Accused No 1 made quarrel with her and gave both physical and mental harassment without providing food and shelter in their house and thrown out from the house and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 498 A read with 34 Indian Penal Code 2 What Order ,FAC
ab9e48bb741747d78a7d43fb202ff39b,5649,5962, The trial court answered the same in the affirmative and convicted the petitioner for an offence punishable under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code 1860 hereinafter referred to as the IPC for brevity and they were sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of one year for the said offence ,RLC
0af141dd31194771a8c4b80c435a1c22,5963,6033,The same having been carried in appeal it was set aside and modified ,RLC
bceed7ce5c7e456fb0b3bfdf044108eb,6034,6157,The parents of the petitioner were acquitted and the conviction and order of sentence against the petitioner was confirmed ,RLC
3c648f84966744d094fbbdbb5cb4db5a,6158,6218,It is that which is under challenge in the present petition ,FAC
860f5c93cbb149d6910e962469360e0c,6218,6362, 6 The learned counsel for the petitioner would contend that the courts below have not appreciated the ingredients of Section 498A of the IPC ,ARG_PETITIONER
6c97cc5a72d94038b9f6b1dc58504d08,6363,6722,It is suggested that the ingredients are that the husband of a woman should have subjected her to cruelty and such cruelty should be with a view to coerce her or any person related to her to meet any unlawful demand of any property or valuable security and that the harassment is on account of failure by her or any person related to her to meet such demand ,ARG_PETITIONER
9c8a4b12adae4632b72c9a19b5296d78,6723,7039,Therefore it would be evident that the law contemplates as a precondition that there should be a valid marriage in accordance with law between the complainant and the accused and the husband should have harassed his wife or treated her with cruelty to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security ,ARG_PETITIONER
fd5ea9f8b2014cdb970c4ab8c8c75751,7040,7178,In the present case on hand the complainant had not at all proved her marriage with the petitioner except producing certain photographs ,ARG_PETITIONER
88f47feaa5134591b9cd6ea67b42371c,7178,7249, Significantly the negatives of the same were never brought on record ,ARG_PETITIONER
7601eafc75254963becbac6677e4b29d,7250,7368,On the basis of such evidence the petitioner could not be termed to be the legally wedded husband of the complainant ,ARG_PETITIONER
db9e0d3d13944feaa91d18b7838fc1fa,7368,7476, Therefore the very first precondition to establish an offence punishable under the said Section is absent ,ARG_PETITIONER
45bb56b5ec234b498d131bedca72837d,7477,7601,There is nothing on record to indicate the custom or rituals in accordance with which the alleged marriage had taken place ,ARG_PETITIONER
2501678bfa3f462da122935b828c135f,7602,7799,The prosecution has sought to rely on Exhibit P 24 which is said to be an undertaking given by the petitioner before the J P Nagar Police to the effect that he would take care of the complainant ,ARG_PETITIONER
2d58509661db46f7a1dd64a8e3a14912,7800,7895,This by itself would not establish that the complainant and the petitioner were legally wedded ,ARG_PETITIONER
484790e712b14af2831ff3133b3c1f9c,7896,7977,PWs 1 to 3 were residents of Dwaralu village the native place of the petitioner ,ARG_PETITIONER
4bc2b2d76d084a6d8df8146ff4e6598f,7977,8082, Significantly they have not spoken about the valid marriage between the complainant and the petitioner ,ARG_PETITIONER
958225dc659b4fa5bb2e62df576720f2,8083,8192,They have also not stated about the complainant and the petitioner having lived together as husband and wife ,ARG_PETITIONER
ce47fa54abd54fe7832e561b64bf9f7e,8193,8349,There is also no indication of any harassment caused by the petitioner to the complainant to meet any unlawful demand for any property or valuable security ,ARG_PETITIONER
912144df1a8e4fafabfb9f661bc5198e,8350,8560,PW 4 who was said to have been present when the complainant and the petitioner got married at the Ganapathi temple has not spoken about the rituals and customs that were performed at the time of the marriage ,ARG_PETITIONER
50931d5793c24b7590d418ea74ea5b49,8561,8669,He has also not endorsed about the complainant and the petitioner having lived together as husband and wife ,ARG_PETITIONER
310b7765741e4a2d9dd2278c50eff8d3,8670,8972,Apart from PW 12 and 13 who were again close relatives and had not stated about the rituals and customs performed at the valid marriage all other witnesses were formal witnesses for the prosecution whose evidence does not establish that there was marriage between the complainant and the petitioner ,ARG_PETITIONER
9035a7d6b34b447b85a6531e7b1857dc,8973,9200,The courts below have glossed over this significant aspect and have treated the marriage as a love marriage and have proceeded to hold that the allegations would constitute an offence punishable under Section 498A of the IPC ,ARG_PETITIONER
73e8d4fa6c71435e8ef7d9d2c8e135db,9201,9348,Significantly the parents of the complainant have not been examined as witnesses in the case atleast to the extent of proving the valid marriage ,ARG_PETITIONER
0b83aff7ac8d4090bc79c7627832a39a,9348,9872, 7 The learned Counsel would place reliance on a judgment in the case of State vs Prasanna Kumar Senapati 2007 Cri LJ 1344 which was an identical case whereby the alleged marriage at a temple was sought to be characterised as a valid marriage and the Orissa High Court had negated the assertion that there was a valid marriage in the absence of a priest who conducted the marriage having been examined and other circumstances which did not implicate the accused in having brought about the death of the alleged wife ,ARG_PETITIONER
3695808948b54487aed17d968dd0fd6c,9872,10541, 8 Reliance is also placed on the case of D Velusamy vs D Patchaiammal 2010 7 Supreme 321 which arose out of a case for maintenance under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code 1973 hereinafter referred to as the Cr P C for brevity and with reference to the expression wife as employed in the said Section the decision of a three judge bench of the Supreme Court in Vimala K vs Veeraswamy K 1991 2 SCC 375 has been followed wherein it was laid down that the expression wife as employed in Section 125 of the Cr P C includes a woman who has been divorced by a husband or who has obtained a divorce from her husband and has not remarried ,ARG_PETITIONER
afd9f91133b340c2a903a4cbd7319ef4,10542,10688,The woman not having the legal status of a wife was thus brought within the inclusive definition of the term wife consistent with the objective ,ARG_PETITIONER
46b193e7023747fb86f70170a08802ef,10689,11089,However under the law a second wife whose marriage is void on account of the survival of the first marriage is not a legally wedded wife and is therefore not entitled to maintenance under the provision and the same has been followed in holding that a woman cannot claim to be the wife unless it is established that the man was not already married in that the first marriage was not subsisting ,ARG_PETITIONER
f77844b36df14a82840bbf25bda19c6c,11090,11552,The learned counsel would further submit that this is also consistent with the view in the case of Savitaben Somabhai Bhatiya vs State of Gujarat AIR 2005 SC 1809 while it has been observed that the Legislature considered it necessary to include within the scope of the provision an illegitimate child but it has not done so with respect to a woman not lawfully married and however desirable it may be to take note of the plight of the unfortunate woman ,ARG_PETITIONER
8215a28518404b178bf1bed1653eb4fc,11553,11780,The legislative intent being clearly reflected in Section 125 of the Cr P C there was no claim for enlarging its scope by introducing any artificial definition to include a woman not lawfully married in the expression wife ,ARG_PETITIONER
b7a1c6c2681c47feb1d19b693e2a498d,11781,12027,Therefore the learned Counsel would submit that the courts below have hence overlooked the primary ingredients which would necessarily have to be present to establish that the offence punishable under Section 498A of the IPC had been committed ,ARG_PETITIONER
8b4e5dc737f445d6bb0ff64d32d96e45,12028,12181,The Counsel hence seeks that the petition be allowed and the judgment of the lower appellate court be set aside insofar as the petitioner is concerned ,ARG_PETITIONER
b3034cb1ac354601a7687b3b98687059,12183,12520,9 On the other hand the learned Government Pleader would submit that the primary contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that there is no valid marriage between the complainant and the petitioner and would submit that the question has been answered in the case of Reema Aggarwal v s Anupam and others 2004 3 SCC 199 ,ARG_RESPONDENT
c0253cfb485e48da8bef3c5039c8c69c,12521,13244,With specific reference to a question as to who would be covered by the expression husband for attracting Section 498A the apex court has held that etymologically in terms of the definitions of husband and marriage as given in the various law lexicons and dictionaries the existence of a valid marriage may appear to be sine qua non for applying a penal provision and has opined that the concept of marriage to constitute the relationship of husband and wife may require strict interpretation where claims for civil rights right to property etc may follow or flow and a liberal approach and the different perception cannot be an anathema when the question of curbing a social evil such as dowry is concerned ,ARG_RESPONDENT
d2aa28c0a65043b5b386963d71efe435,13244,13374,The apex court has further observed that if the legality of the marriage itself is an issue further legalistic problems do arise ,ARG_RESPONDENT
8d04ffb13b1c46d889976462f0fbaaf2,13375,13536,In that if the validity of the marriage itself is under legal scrutiny the demand of dowry in respect of an invalid marriage would be legally not recognizable ,ARG_RESPONDENT
5bf505ba574042859c775e4f8e94061d,13537,13703,Even then the purpose for which Section 498A and Section 304 B IPC as well as Section 113E of the Indian Evidence Act 1872 were introduced cannot be lost sight of ,ARG_RESPONDENT
998ae62e197d44789de0c0906f7c37da,13704,13866,The legislation enacted with some policy to curb and alleviate some public evil rampant in society requires to be interpreted with a certain element of realism ,ARG_RESPONDENT
98528952ac0d4bc6b6c75226e2ee3a12,13867,14470,Therefore the legalistic niceties would destroy the purpose of the provisions and therefore concluded that whatever be the legitimacy of the marriage itself for the limited purpose of Section 498A and 304B of the Indian Penal Code the interpretation known as purposive construction would come into play in such circumstances and the absence of a definition of husband is specifically include such persons who contract marriage ostensibly and cohabit with such woman in the purported exercise of their role and status as husband is no ground to exclude them from the purview of the said sections ,ARG_RESPONDENT
668d9f6ef6a44b8ea4e0dbd4714f106d,14470,14627, 10 The learned Government Pleader would therefore rely on the said judgment to support the contention that a legally valid marriage is not a precondition ,ARG_RESPONDENT
ae41afdef57a454ebc3c0f031c25ba1e,14628,15023,This decision has been relied upon and applied in yet another judgment of the apex court in the case of U Suvetha vs State by Inspector of Police 2009 2 Crimes 357 and has cited with approval the opinion of the Kerala High Court in the case of John Idiculla vs State of Kerala 2005 MLJ Crl 841 where a wider meaning to the word second wife has been given in the following words 25 ,ANALYSIS
fa110d1f7fac4757b0011e9f56c17c64,15024,15225,The test under Section 498A Indian Penal Code is whether in the facts of each case it is probable that a woman is treated by friends relatives husband or society as a wife or as a mere mistress ,ANALYSIS
98fd9bbd1507479ba3f054c2aa1a9bad,15226,15468,If from the pleading and evidence the Court finds that the woman concerned is regarded as wife and not as a mere mistress she can be considered to be a wife and consequently as the relative of the husband for purpose of Section 498A IPC ,ANALYSIS
6cb42091febb41d9aed4576c7a77d024,15468,15618, Proof of a legal marriage in the rigid sense as required under civil law is unnecessary for establishing an offence under Section 498A IPC ,ANALYSIS
5bd928d3d8f84c90abc2f9cd4f1a69f1,15619,15817,The expression marriage or relative can be given only a diluted meaning which a common man or society may attribute to those concepts in the common parlance for the purpose of Section 498A IPC ,ANALYSIS
846c58f889cc4868b22282ef88971484,15818,15994,A second wife who is treated as wife by the husband relatives friends or society can be considered to be the relative of the husband for the purpose of Section 498A of IPC ,ANALYSIS
d6eefe1f88444fc88f61ee42b4d45c90,15995,16124,If she inflicts cruelty on the legally wedded wife of the husband an offence under Section 498A IPC will not lie against her ,ANALYSIS
86f58d3d759e486c8784e7fac4038c72,16124,16528,And the learned Government Pleader would submit that the first ingredient of Section 498A stands satisfied insofar as the present case on hand in that there are certain photographs produced coupled with the fact that the petitioner had given an undertaking before the jurisdictional police and the eye witness to the marriage were sufficient to establish that the petitioner had married the respondent ,ARG_RESPONDENT
42420039d4074810b453da21460e375e,16528,16645, It was not even a case where the marriage was alleged to be a second marriage thereby rendering it a void marriage ,ANALYSIS
39d2e15e6ac1460ab03dd48d7c25de22,16646,16726,It is not the case of the petitioner that the complainant was a stranger to him ,ANALYSIS
ae380147029c48d68707b48f53ecc374,16727,16818,The insistence on strict proof of marriage as laid down in the above decisions is not so ,ANALYSIS
e8566016579346538f9e306763fd21dd,16818,17311, 11 Insofar as the cruelty which requires to be established is concerned is on account of the fact that there was reluctance on the part of the petitioner to marry the complainant citing lack of financial independence compelling the complainant to part with valuable property coupled with the fact that cruelty as contemplated under Section 498A has been defined in a wider sense and cannot be restricted in the manner as sought to be canvassed by the learned counsel for the petitioner ,ANALYSIS
7203cfae6bf142c8b1d91136f4a27a3c,17312,17585,The punishment has been imposed with particular reference to the degree of cruelty that has been established and therefore it is not a case which would warrant interference by this court in a revision and hence the Government Pleader prays that the petition be dismissed ,ANALYSIS
45b9f61568734951affaeb3d695b4604,17585,17917, 12 In the above facts and circumstances and with reference to the law as laid down by the apex court for purposes of Section 498A of the IPC though it may not be essential that a legally valid marriage is established it was necessary to establish that the petitioner and the complainant had lived together as husband and wife ,ANALYSIS
35cbe6b07b9e49b29dbd89b2905494b4,17918,17976,In this regard there is sadly no evidence is forthcoming ,ANALYSIS

087dcbfa14a84f1b8b5951d83c79eef6,18186,18505,Further insofar as the second limb of the requirements under Section 498A is also not established for the reason that there is not even an allegation of the petitioner having demanded or coerced the complainant to meet any unlawful demand and of the complainant having been harassed on her failure to meet such demand ,ANALYSIS
8ea94cf3876b438ca78ec9ffb5c38903,18506,18679,The mere allegation of desertion whether it was bordered on cruelty was never within the purview of the courts below and it is outside the scope of this revision petition ,ANALYSIS
c21620dd953d4372884b5894b675b236,18679,18890, Therefore the primary ingredients necessary to constitute an offence punishable under Section 498A were clearly absent and hence the conviction of the petitioner by both the courts below is clearly bad in law ,RATIO
19af797a3d1648afb2a5877bebb273ae,18890,19044, Accordingly the petition is allowed and the judgment of the courts below is set aside insofar as the conviction of the present petitioner is concerned ,RPC

27084751c0764d18bb1abcf191bebd84,6858,7197,Mr N P Sahni learned standing counsel for the Revenue submitted that the ITAT had erred in law in deleting the addition made by the AO under Section 68 of Act 1961 as the assessee had failed to discharge the burden in respect of the identity of the share applicants genuineness of transaction and creditworthiness of share applicants ,ARG_PETITIONER
81cf68be47054190a67c561da78a2c4e,7198,7624,In support of his submission he relied upon following judgments A CIT Vs Rathi Finlease Ltd 215 CTR 167 M P wherein it has been held as under 17 S 68 of the Act enjoined the assessee to offer an explanation about the nature and source of the sum found credited in his books and if the explanation was not satisfactory the amount can be credited and charged to income tax as income of the assessee ,ARG_PETITIONER
1707d6a47b4d44ed8d0e5a29ed1f6e69,7625,7964,Since the assessee though tried to explain the genuineness of the credit on the basis of letters of confirmation it could not be explained as to how the transaction was materialized when the companies were not in existence and the amount was paid by cheque only on the date on which the amount was credited to the account of the company ,ARG_PETITIONER

c63354a63f2f45829dec0741d452c73e,8860,9202, As we read Section 68 it appears that whenever a sum is found credited in the books of account of the assessee then irrespective of the colour or the nature of the sum received which is sought to be given by the assessee the Income tax Officer has the jurisdiction to enquire from the assessee the nature and source of the said amount ,ARG_PETITIONER
d73a78b2a06e49b6a4b829e0934630f4,9203,9368,When an explanation in regard thereto is given by the assessee then it is for the Income tax Officer to be satisfied whether the said explanation is correct or not ,ARG_PETITIONER
bd42ae55f6534aff96ed18e5b1c076a9,9369,9552,It is in this regard that enquiries are usually made in order to find out as to whether firstly the persons from whom money is alleged to have been received actually existed or not ,ARG_PETITIONER
13dafdaeb5ca4645bd923a0e440293c6,9553,9800,Secondly depending upon the facts of each case the Income tax Officer may even be justified in trying to ascertain the source of the depositor assuming he is identified in order to determine whether that depositor is a mere name lender or not ,ARG_PETITIONER
385de4c1144044579251b747f27dabb0,9801,10166,Be that as it may it is clear that the Income tax Officer has jurisdiction to make enquiries with regard to the nature and source of a sum credited in the books of account of an assessee and it would be immaterial as to whether the amount so credited is given the colour of a loan or a sum representing the sale proceeds or even receipt of share application money ,ARG_PETITIONER
4ff79d9181164c44a8ec920d205044a9,10167,10522,The use of the words any sum found credited in the books in section 68 indicates that the said section is very widely worded and an Income tax officer is not precluded from making an enquiry as to the true nature and source thereof even if the same is credited as receipt of share application money xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx ,ARG_PETITIONER
eaa58e3410604810bc3be91579ee8b79,10522,11433, On the basis of the language used under Section 68 and the various decisions of different High Courts and the Apex Court the only conclusion which could be arrived at is i that there is no distinction between the cash credit entry existing in the books of the firm whether it is of a partner or of a third party ii that the burden to prove the identity capacity and genuineness has to be on the assessee iii if the cash credit is not satisfactorily explained the Income Tax Officer is justified to treat it as Income from undisclosed sources iv the firm has to establish that the amount was actually given by the lender v the genuineness and regularity in the maintenance of the account has to be taken into consideration by the taxing authorities vi if the explanation is not supported by any documentary or other evidence then the deeming fiction credited by Section 68 can be invoked ,ARG_PETITIONER
a4fe4730070d4edf972f75922c893d48,11434,11731,In these circumstances we are of the view that simply because the amount is credited in the books of the firm in the partner s capital account it cannot be said that it is not the undisclosed income of the firm and in all cases it has to be assessed as an undisclosed income of the partner alone ,ARG_PETITIONER
1da3be20fced4a0fb50bd5607c8f1c85,11732,11985,In these circumstances we are of the view that the Tribunal was not justified in holding that the cash credits of Rs 11 502 in the account of Shri Kishorilal one of the partners could not be assessed in the hands of the firm and in deleting the same ,ARG_PETITIONER
c14b2aa179274522917cca179ce7bc55,11986,12179,Since the matter was not considered by the Tribunal on the merits the Tribunal would be free to hear the arguments of both the parties and decide afresh in view of the observations made above ,ARG_PETITIONER

53a3624e65bf4773bedde402c939d75b,12416,12525,The income tax file number has been given but that is not enough to prove the genuineness of the cash credit ,ARG_PETITIONER
85d9d9418d4a498eb377fa23235f716a,12526,12603,Admittedly there is no affidavit to this effect by the creditor on record ,ARG_PETITIONER
1e1c262c64964572aa5e8026ccb04d12,12604,12697,Considering these facts we find that the finding of the Tribunal in this regard is perverse ,ARG_PETITIONER

f09d63dd34f841ff8ce7aa5095c9439d,12861,13215, Therefore from the series of decisions of various High Courts it is well established that in such a situation where there is a credit entry in the books of account of the assessee and there is no satisfactory explanation then it will be deemed to be the income of the firm and will be added to the income of the firm and can be accordingly taxed ,ARG_PETITIONER

4c59ef16dfea45d9a8d6e58f56b28347,13792,14146,But in view of Section 68 of the Act where any sum is found credited in the books of the assessee for any previous year the same may be charged to income tax as the income of the assessee of that previous year if the explanation offered by the assessee about the nature and source thereof is in the opinion of the Assessing Officer not satisfactory ,ARG_PETITIONER

5868f70267d64233855141a22739a1bc,9321,9634, 17 The first contention of the accused that cheque in question was given to the complainant as a loan however it was subject to the complainant executing a promissory note and furnishing a guarantor in favour of the accused was for the first time canvassed by the accused in the cross examination of PW 1 ,ANALYSIS

d214d9ccadc141b1870a2e015d19d9a3,9742,10042,It was suggested to PW 1 that the complainant PW 1 wanted to join the Police Service as a Sub Inspector of Police and also wanted to put up a house in a vacant site belonging to him and towards the same he had taken the loan from the accused However the complainant did not admit the same as true ,ANALYSIS
8fc3deac82f8473ba0adc4f5ad69db5b,10042,10149, The accused who got himself examined as DW 4 also reiterated the same stand in his Examination in chief ,ANALYSIS
c569d63840fe439eb61cb6d833962fae,10150,10232, However the complainant made denial suggestions to him in his cross examination ,ANALYSIS
76220a538f4a42a7a6e030645ce69209,10234,10611,18 In order to show that cheque in question along with one more similar cheque was given to the complainant as a loan but with a condition of he executing a demand promissory note has been confined only in the form of a suggestion by the accused to the complainant and the same is not supported either by any oral evidence of any other witness or by any documentary evidence ,ANALYSIS
8d0aea2cd0c04e96961d9c04cdbcdfaa,10611,11147, The said contention that the cheque in question was given as a loan to the complainant cannot be accepted for the following reasons i The accused though says that he had issued two cheques to the complainant as loan no where he has stated as to what was the loan amount he wanted to give to the complainant and nowhere he has stated as to the loan amount mentioned in the cheques given by him ii Admittedly the accused DW 4 is an educated person working as a Civil Engineer and knows the consequences of issuance of a cheque ,ANALYSIS

fa8b1cdbae6041cab052fe81161b9052,11213,11489, That being the case when he was aware of the consequences of issuance of a cheque his statement that without getting or before getting the promissory note or the guarantor he ventured to issue two cheques without any amount mentioned therein is very difficult to believe ,ANALYSIS
e2511349d4de4091afa6ca16cc4c8a8c,11489,11778, iii If the accused had really intended to give loan to the complainant and cheques were in fact issued to the complainant not as a repayment of the loan but as a loan by accused himself to the complainant then the accused was expected to have sufficient balance in his Bank Account ,ANALYSIS
fff1d27cf66a4c48a6acc8f7430b0710,11779,11858,Admittedly the cheque when presented was dishonoured as funds insufficient ,ANALYSIS
329467b9a4df488fbcbce2175eba80d9,11860,12070, iv No doubt the accused has given an explanation in his cross examination that he had arranged money and wanted to remit the money in his account provided the complainant executed the demand promissory note ,ANALYSIS

27ca6c54695e433eb9894e19df5c9e1a,12701,12953,Therefore the defence of the accused that the cheque in question was given not towards the repayment of the loan but as a loan to be given by him to the complainant has neither been established by him nor would inspire any confidence to believe it ,ANALYSIS
41313a4f10714864b04792d1b1dc0d00,12953,13103, As such the first contention of the accused that the cheque in question was given as a loan but not as a repayment towards loan is not acceptable ,ANALYSIS
538c03c6c90144b4b7bd209d95757b8b,13103,13309, 19 The second argument from the aside of the accused which was also his contention in the Lower Appellate Court is that the complainant had no capacity or source to lend the cheque amount to the accused ,ANALYSIS

1bd99e14e1a349009ca9d3ab90ddbbbe,13783,14089,PW 1 has also stated that in the year 2000 which is the relevant year in this case of loan transaction he was getting monthly salary of a sum of 8 000 and out of it he used to incur expenditure of a sum of 3 000 to 4 000 towards maintenance of the family and rest of the amount he was saving ,ANALYSIS
9c60bfdd87b443688ec485fb819d0938,14090,14187,Thus according to PW 1 every month he was saving not less than 4 000 to 5 000 per month ,ANALYSIS

52af3d0a609049e981a7b2f68dfbcde5,16255,16625, 23 From the above evidence of DW 1 DW 2 and DW 3 though it could be inferred that as on 14 11 2000 there was no balance equivalent to the alleged loan amount in any of or all the three bank accounts of the complainant put together but it is not the case of the complainant that he had only these three bank accounts and did not have any other account in his name ,ANALYSIS
515b3dc6f5db4b5ba91283cf87441876,16627,16843,24 It was not even suggested to PW 1 in his cross examination that except these three bank accounts with respect to whom DW 1 DW 2 and DW 3 were examined the complainant had no other accounts in any other banks ,ANALYSIS
80b50d0f7eb9401abfad69fc1964dea5,16843,17053,Further it is also not the statement of PW 1 that he withdrew any portion of the loan amount from any one of these three bank accounts and on any particular day more particularly on 14 11 2000 or 14 10 2000 ,ANALYSIS
821bdcf34a894f12bf2bf48ad7732196,17054,17433,That being the case without ascertaining from PW 1 or without suggesting to PW 1 that he had only these three bank accounts and that he had withdrawn a particular sum from any of these three bank accounts on a particular date merely examining three bank officials would not help the accused in any manner to establish or show that the complainant had no capacity to lend money ,ANALYSIS
92cc3ba42ecd467abad7b04752662dee,17435,17638,25 As already observed above the complainant has no where stated that it is only after withdrawing the amount from a particular bank account on a particular date that he has lent money to the accused ,ANALYSIS

788cc14a1f304b4eab9ee0934c596e7e,17849,17981, 26 Thus the contention of the accused that the complainant had no financial source or capacity to lend money is not acceptable ,ANALYSIS
46e3a6533c814f9c902ac99232328cd9,17982,18078,His attempt to rebut the presumption has fallen short of giving him the favour he was expecting ,ANALYSIS
2ea7156931bf4285ab10988719ccc728,18078,18476, 27 The Lower Appellate Court without analyzing the evidence in its proper perspective has been carried away only by the evidence of DW 1 DW 2 and DW 3 and jumped to a conclusion that the complainant had no financial capacity to lend money which resulted in it setting aside the judgment of the Trial Court which was a very reasoned one after due appreciation of the evidence placed before it ,ANALYSIS
6687080e2c714043a289f07da869509a,18476,18949, 28 In such a situation when the issuance of cheque in favour of the complainant is an admitted fact and the presumption under Section 139 of the N I Act was operating in favour of the complainant and when the accused could not able to rebut the said presumption though he has led his evidence and examined few witnesses the only inference that could be drawn is that the complainant could able to prove the alleged guilt against the accused beyond reasonable doubts ,ANALYSIS
3fad94fd5c2d4470b4798cb064af2607,18950,19083,However the Lower Appellate Court as observed above has wrongly reversed the finding of the Trial Court and acquitted the accused ,ANALYSIS
3e6bab736c8c44dcbe156ece22a49db9,19083,19310, 29 The Trial Court since has appropriately held the accused guilty of the alleged offence after appreciating the evidence placed before it in its proper perspective I do not find any reason to interfere in the said finding ,RATIO

cba5e3dc8b584315a656dfe860122b68,4530,4682, 5 Impugning the findings of the Sessions Court the counsel for the appellant firstly argues that the charge framed against the accused is defective ,ARG_PETITIONER
11cca00c1099499b9c643891c5034616,4683,4776,In the charge it is stated that the age of the girl was 15 years on the date of the incident ,ARG_PETITIONER
ae27db4633464fd2a0dbe9ba5d1fcf64,4777,4896,But Ex P3 the document produced by the prosecution to prove the age of the girl shows her date of birth as 16 1 1994 ,ARG_PETITIONER
e3f5a035169748a99e8be4de71e802cd,4897,4970,Therefore her age on the date of alleged incident was 16 years 6 months ,ARG_PETITIONER
01a2919dc47443659a4f3a1c4f52a2b0,4971,5166,If the correct age had been mentioned in the charge it would have given the accused an opportunity to take a line of defence that it was not an incident of rape rather a consensual intercourse ,ARG_PETITIONER
797476da05d545ecb6d54e9e895822a1,5167,5296,Since the charge is defective the accused was denied of taking defence in this manner and therefore his interest is prejudiced ,ARG_PETITIONER
1b53689de9b34444995ed0e894c54ae5,5296,5416,For this reason the case requires to be remanded to the trial court for correcting the charge and holding denovo trial ,ARG_PETITIONER
a80b4f4dcaf041d5a8ee7ec98fa39f48,5418,5523,5 1 Secondly he argues that in Ex P1 the first information the offences mentioned are 354 and 506 IPC ,ARG_PETITIONER
84190d99230c4f4eb41c960f3793e2f5,5524,5649,Even if Ex P7 is read it only gives an impression that some attempt might have been made to outrage the modesty of the girl ,ARG_PETITIONER
f76fad84a7354b16ace18a535a7c04a0,5650,5693,The victim girl was studying in I year PUC ,ARG_PETITIONER
4ea575cf3bb54a9fadfa0640f779dbe3,5694,5783,If really an incident of rape had taken place she could have revealed the same in Ex P1 ,ARG_PETITIONER
ab04b4f8fdaf4c459c65301edfbf0a1b,5784,5809,It is in her handwriting ,ARG_PETITIONER
da75d9144127411a997948f5a83be374,5810,6000,He further refers to Ex P8 the medical certificate and argues that the doctor noticed only two external injuries namely an abrasion over the right knee and an abrasion over the left thigh ,ARG_PETITIONER
ad94480db0c343b5b50b06abcdcd788e,6001,6061,These injuries show that the girl was not subjected to rape ,ARG_PETITIONER
d2f603b73e984393bf567fd6633dd881,6062,6174,Indirectly the medical certificate supports the defence version that there was consent on the part of the girl ,ARG_PETITIONER
821a52d2ec87435e80700093ff3d2106,6175,6317,If it was a case of rape the doctor would have noticed some other injuries near the genital organ of the girl or some other resistance marks ,ARG_PETITIONER
d5021b8b86a84edcb670963174f017da,6318,6440,If Ex P8 does not disclose injuries of this nature the inference that can be drawn is that it was a case of consent only ,ARG_PETITIONER
168eec5fc9b04b9e8231a22888b87ce6,6441,6596,In this regard he further argues that the alleged date of incident is 25 7 2010 i e before amendment was brought to section 375 of IPC in the year 2013 ,ARG_PETITIONER
86f01a8ed2ee44d1817af9338fe58374,6597,6823,Before amendment a consensual act of intercourse with a female up to the age of 16 years was not an offence and for this reason the entire case of the prosecution could be brought within the purview of sixthly of section 375 ,ARG_PETITIONER
5d377ee29ab84c50929ea696ae83a2a7,6824,6933,He garnered support for his argument from Ex P3 in which the date of birth of the girl is shown as 16 1 1994 ,ARG_PETITIONER
4eeaf9e6bc8b408aa9fca846a3cf118e,6934,7130,His another point of argument is that nothing prevented the victim s father examined as PW2 from disclosing the incident before the police to see that a complaint under section 376 was registered ,ARG_PETITIONER
37272f74c1454bce8318695edcfb3fb5,7131,7176,Therefore PW2 also becomes untrusty witness ,ARG_PETITIONER
0aab760a4d434fdca53bc8a6f419c1a9,7177,7228,He argues that PWs3 and 4 are the chance witnesses ,ARG_PETITIONER
ab79f1c6662046bab54095f0f15eb697,7229,7373,Even if the evidence of these two witnesses is believable it is possible to say that their evidence also shows consent on the part of the girl ,ARG_PETITIONER
794d5ed92bff4e91bd5c2162220fc1af,7374,7591,Therefore it is his argument that if all these aspects are taken into consideration though a specific defence of consent was not introduced during cross examination it is possible to draw inferences in this manner ,ARG_PETITIONER
4125b1877e3a4d03a9d33f2f925f9180,7592,7722,The trial court has failed to appreciate the evidence in proper perspective and thus the judgment of the trial court is erroneous ,ARG_PETITIONER
cd8ee0acc58f41c4adcdbf32e4813ce9,7722,7987, 6 Countering the argument of the learned counsel for the appellant Sri Vijayakumar Majage Additional SPP argues that any defect in charge is not a matter to be considered seriously unless the accused is able to demonstrate as to how his interest is prejudiced ,ARG_RESPONDENT
5b4ad423ddc9410f926fc82a9bf7a1f7,7987,8073, Moreover there is evidence of doctor PW8 that the age of the girl was 13 to 14 years ,ARG_RESPONDENT
6a36f29402e74ddca266f1cc28432016,8074,8157,The theory of consent is not available as PW1 was not cross examined in that angle ,ARG_RESPONDENT
e7855346398e4d98a65625549ca3a950,8158,8227,The cross examination of PW1 shows that she has not been discredited ,ARG_RESPONDENT
9a0ff8e1bc4d42baa250554fc40f80df,8228,8307,The evidence of the doctor PW 9 who examined the girl has not been discredited ,ARG_RESPONDENT
3ea43670072441b896b8dc88081c1cfc,8308,8457,In fact two external injuries noticed by the doctor shows that the girl was forcibly dragged to a dilapidated house where the offence was committed ,ARG_RESPONDENT
85a8dac132344212a572c914c3bd3dac,8458,8600,There are no infirmities in the findings given by the trial court and therefore the judgment of the trial court should not be interfered with ,ARG_RESPONDENT
1ecb17ec575f4a4bab706b6f89b485b6,8600,8700, 7 We have considered the points of arguments and perused the evidence both oral and documentary ,ANALYSIS
b5c06d7f80bf4cb5b8ca639727ed4970,8700,8934, It is true that when the first information was given to the police as per Ex P1 on 29 7 2010 the victim girl just stated that she was sought to be outraged by a boy who met her while she was returning from a bakery at about 9 15 pm ,ANALYSIS
e078935a91f24a9f81201dc532b072e2,8935,9018,The actual incident as disclosed in Ex P1 is said to have taken place on 25 7 2010 ,ANALYSIS
17b656480c074709976cfbf07098c42f,9019,9073,There is a delay of 4 days in reporting to the police ,ANALYSIS
7ba6c15a31ee4658998067bbbdecb004,9074,9237,In regard to delay we too are of the opinion that no girl dares to reveal the incident soon after the incident and therefore delay cannot be seriously considered ,ANALYSIS
0a22ecf0463e416ab1c06fb2e4c1b190,9237,9532, 8 With regard to one line of argument advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant regarding defect in charge we have to state that though the age is mentioned as 15 years in the charge Ex P3 the age proof produced by the prosecution shows that date of birth of the girl is 16 1 1994 ,ANALYSIS
f401d29cc054442d9f99ba96935a63c8,9533,9583,The prosecution cannot go back upon this document ,ANALYSIS
9a1fbac25a0345ff803d1f900072524c,9584,9684,Therefore on the date of the alleged incident the age of the girl appears to be 16 years 6 months ,ANALYSIS
dd345a5a6649407b850de685390b7450,9685,9813,But the argument of the learned counsel that on account of defect in charge he was deprived of the defence cannot be accepted ,ANALYSIS
c5b7e8f4e3af41d9aa854235ff9f68d7,9814,9941,Defect in charge is not a matter that can be taken note of unless that defect seriously prejudices the interest of the accused ,ANALYSIS
14b4c11a409442548d1ba5e835795731,9942,10210,Having noticed the correct date of birth nothing prevented the accused from making an application before the trial court to correctly mention the age of the girl in the charge or taking up a defence with regard to consent while cross examining the material witnesses ,ANALYSIS
ab3c22d2cf234abfa44673ee73bf1056,10211,10285,Neither the victim girl nor the investigation officer has been questioned ,ANALYSIS
88260ff9f3114192b4eb7b07d215a5a4,10286,10329,Therefore this argument is not acceptable ,ANALYSIS
6314b375a83c43d79e9d3595475d1a81,10330,10552,However on perusing the evidence of the other material witnesses PWs1 and 2 and also the doctor PW9 we have to arrive at a conclusion different from the findings given by the trial court for the following reasons 8 1 ,ANALYSIS

8c1d173e94754d35b6da2dfcb465a9ad,14323,14481,Though a suggestion has been given to PW5 that the date mentioned in Ex P3 is not correct it cannot be given much importance because it is just a suggestion ,ANALYSIS
a4c0c55cbc804f5d976b0713a1d4e75f,14482,14603,The prosecution cannot make use of this suggestion to hold that the age of the girl on the date of incident was 15 years ,ANALYSIS
3742f7b79dac432286bb2338d65c829b,14604,14670,Ex P3 is produced by the prosecution and it binds the prosecution ,ANALYSIS
66d4576717a34827aa0df3adcf51d404,14671,14782,Therefore the age of the girl on the date of incident was not 15 years her correct age was 16 years 6 months ,ANALYSIS
408bca5d81dd46fd83bc374d9413fff5,14783,14945,What we need to examine here is whether consent on the part of the girl can be inferred although such a defence has not been put forward in the cross examination ,ANALYSIS
2900841807a34df889d7ec289e3cda44,14946,15193,In our opinion such inferences can certainly be drawn from the evidence in examination in chief itself if inklings to that effect are available though sometimes specific defence is not introduced in cross examination or defence evidence not lead ,ANALYSIS
86aa7371ec5e4dc3b0103c7f7d6720d9,15194,15307,If this benefit is available to the accused that has to be given notwithstanding such a defence being not taken ,ANALYSIS
fcb8b9c6c61a42699cbe9ca843474b77,15308,15445,As has been referred to above PW1 has clearly stated the way in which she was taken to a dilapidated place and subjected to intercourse ,ANALYSIS
060185a56b1b4ca683f203508d0a2ccc,15446,15504,The same thing is revealed by her before PWs 3 and 4 also ,ANALYSIS
68b6c38a84364889abf07f6e7571cdbe,15505,15672,If evidence of PWs1 3 and 4 is scrutinized it can be very much said that she knew the accused even before the incident took place as he happened to be her neighbour ,ANALYSIS
7a4ad8bd24184c2d80a775676a5f4862,15673,15844,In addition to evidence of PW1 about removal of clothes and spreading a piece of cloth on the floor what can be made out from medical certificate Ex P8 is also important ,ANALYSIS
a5642865abaa4ab9ba8883499b76400e,15845,15890,Only two injuries were noticed by the doctor ,ANALYSIS
dce79c95538541178fb8acda7cf5c3a8,15891,15926,He has mentioned the same in Ex P8 ,ANALYSIS
4e3a459c7f104e8d84421bff7114661f,15927,15979,They are abrasions on the right knee and left thigh ,ANALYSIS
8fdc6b821fcc467fa63d9dd08584de54,15980,16154,The State Public Prosecutor has argued that these injuries in fact show that she was forcibly taken to a dilapidated house or otherwise such injuries would not have occurred ,ANALYSIS
4975c323395f4c57b63e9ee36c4923b9,16155,16192,Of course this argument is plausible ,ANALYSIS
477c2e326cd94a1a8470b016271c4dfc,16193,16310,It is also true that the evidence of PW9 shows that he noticed signs of recent intercourse when he examined the girl ,ANALYSIS
78e61391abb94766bb22bdade400c55c,16311,16415,But these injuries and evidence of PW9 by themselves will not lead to conclusion being drawn about rape ,ANALYSIS
e411a2ba6ab04df1b022452afe4c548c,16416,16451,There are other circumstances also ,ANALYSIS
a8158dfcf346401688afa20fbf68a97f,16452,16582,In an incident relating to rape the evidence of prosecutrix must be trustworthy only then her sole testimony can be relied upon ,ANALYSIS
ab63c4a6408d42b0a3c5f721234bfdcd,16583,16640,The medical evidence is only corroborative nothing more ,ANALYSIS
b7c5b11725f24e0092b490c0fe8f3259,16642,16767,10 There remains the evidence of PW3 and PW4 who have stated they heard the scream of PW1 and went to the place of incident ,ANALYSIS
480b5efd981640409ee1924edb7cc22d,16768,16815,But their evidence is difficult to be believed ,ANALYSIS
b013c2a41fc7438d907fec8458599375,16816,16932,If they accompanied PW1 till her house they did not inform the father of PW2 about what they came to know from PW1 ,ANALYSIS
ef3e76d2a36143358304bfe56daf9519,16933,17108,If PW2 was present in the house when PW3 or PW4 brought her the former should have spoken in examination in chief that PW3 or PW4 brought his daughter to house on that night ,ANALYSIS
5b23d2b6e3ac4927b54c8a7f341845f7,17109,17251,Even if he was not present he should have deposed so because such a testimony of PW2 would have corroborated the testimonies of PW3 and PW4 ,ANALYSIS
83920245844442d3b37438cb3a2f8863,17252,17348,This is an important circumstance which if established makes the testimony of PW1 believable ,ANALYSIS
5679697048ac478e9bfcb8a182ca20cc,17349,17496,The answer given by PW4 in the cross examination clearly shows that he and PW3 met PW2 on the date of incident but they did not tell him anything ,ANALYSIS
1414af2f1f204285b1d9789cf2209e29,17497,17628,Added to this PW4 has also stated that PW3 CW4 and he had gone to that place and did not see accused running away from that place ,ANALYSIS
c5b1eb975c024f8a9c2974ea88090684,17629,17721,This being the evidence of PW4 it is not safe to place reliance on evidence of PW3 and PW4 ,ANALYSIS
f91ac221546046c4921f6cceb30cfbf7,17722,17921,The evidence of PW2 is also difficult to be relied upon for he being the father of PW1 could have at the time of lodging FIR by PW1 brought to the notice of police about actual incident of rape ,ANALYSIS
db169eb91e66468ca8b42f04c05ad0a9,17921,17992, 11 The age of the girl as per Ex P3 appears to be 16 years 6 months ,ANALYSIS
57e726a81cfc403baa2723ef28185b00,17993,18094,Evidence in examination in chief shows semblance of consent and her evidence lacks credit worthiness ,ANALYSIS
0d5182b29b944403b6f9c8f8ae32d547,18095,18283,Therefore we arrive at a conclusion that the reasons ascribed by the learned Sessions Judge for holding that the prosecution has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt cannot be accepted ,RATIO
68343c7c24ca47219809944bc0ddff19,18284,18387,The doubts that arise from the scrutiny of the evidence of PW1 PW2 PW3 or PW4 have remained answered ,RATIO

d29ad0f8bb7744759c51b337db29cdf4,8784,9270, 5 Mr Sridharan learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the assessee in all these matters submitted that the arguments raised by the revenue before the Maharashtra Sales Tax Tribunal were as follows a Entry C I 19 does not cover compounds of aromatic chemicals but the entry covers only the compounds of natural synthetic essential oils and no other compounds b Entry C I 19 covers only the compounds which are sold as single entity in form which is almost pure ,ARG_PETITIONER
442cfd77a52a40ef9699e05949a72b51,9270,9386, c Entry C I 19 relates only to compounds treated individually i e without requirement of specific formulation ,ARG_PETITIONER
843cedbf04be40ff8a6b15a54812a8bc,9387,9442,In other words it does not cover any prepared mixture ,ARG_PETITIONER
7fb688fbf98b4da4a9f36558f1308a96,9443,9705,On the three questions framed he submitted that as far as the first question reproduced above the Tribunal had answered this question in its judgment dated 31st March 2003 as follows The reading of the entry C I 19 done by the revenue is not quite proper ,ARG_PETITIONER
c2fcf3cffb7a424481c24fd880025f82,9706,9844,The words their compounds therein would obviously mean the compounds of the Aromatic Chemicals and Synthetic and Natural Essential Oils ,ARG_PETITIONER
9e507fbd02154f41af8342d5c1c11e65,9845,9976,They would certainly not mean compounds merely of synthetic and natural essential oils as sought to be interpreted by the revenue ,ARG_PETITIONER
43f398bf68c446d0be06e6b7e2c0da10,9977,10163,When the synthetic and natural oils themselves were covered by C I 19 there was obviously no need to specify that even the compounds of such oils would also be covered by the same entry ,ARG_PETITIONER
836a635aa0d740c8962053a81b4f7beb,10164,10337,As compounds of various chemicals are covered by the term chemicals the compounds of the aforesaid oils are also covered by the term synthetic and natural essential oils ,ARG_PETITIONER
951d2bd93082402e8b4588f6905d3a64,10338,10507,In that view of the matter it is absolutely clear that the words their compounds in C I 19 means not the compounds of oils but the compounds of aromatic and oils ,ARG_PETITIONER

822eb57ed18b4c00a70b01655100ad54,11360,11441,A specimen of such letter is also set out in the order of the Appellate Tribunal ,FAC
87998a6fd2ac41faa65825d4231e25bb,11442,11963,in such communication the Eastern Bank Ltd Madras informed the assessee company that I in accordance with advices received by letter from our London Office a confirmed and irrevocable credit has been opened in your favour by Messrs Morgan Grenfell Co Ltd London for account of Messrs W R Grace Co New York for a sum not exceeding pound 7 300 seven thousand three hundred pounds sterling in all available by delivery to us on or before 15th January 1940 of the following documents ,FAC
f076f3509a814d86bed4980621294993,11964,12224,Towards the end of the letter the Eastern Bank Ltd Madras used to write that they were prepared in our options as customary to negotiate drafts drawn in terms of the arrangement provided that the documents as above mentioned appear to us to be in order ,FAC
15b7fc0dbea84e5ba56e278a5ed7f9a6,12224,12374, The letter concluded with a warning that the advice was given for your guidance and without involving any rosponsi bility on the part of this Bank ,FAC
596e6de6e5034b898c99cd6e5b5c2741,12375,12533, On receipt of such intimation the assessee company placed the contracted goods on board the steamer at Madras and obtained A bill of lading in its own name ,FAC
92ab7071d9864cbeb0c8d179c616476c,12534,12607,As already mentioned the shipments were made principally at Madras Port ,FAC
6bf245fb14214a569a54199acd0b91b1,12608,13187,Thereafter the assessee company used to make out a provisional invoice on the basis of the bill of lading weight and contract price for 48 per cent Cr 203 and used to draw a bill of exchange on the buyers Bank where the letter of credit had been opened for 90 per cent of the amount of the provisional invoice payable at sight in the case of European contracts and 80 per cent of the amount of the provisional invoice at 90 days sight in the case of American contracts and in either case the bills of exchange used to be drawn in favour of theEastern Batik Ltd London ,FAC
9201db4ddf8849d1a1603b4dbe20f9ee,13188,13494,The bill of exchange together with the relative bill of lading endorsed in blank by the assessee company and the provisional invoice was then negotiated with the Eastern Bank Ltd Madras the bankers of the assessee company Who used to credit the assessee company with the amount of the bill of exchange ,FAC
40674d83d7744ef9b14cc4d4b5d2a5f9,13495,13807,The Eastern Bank Ltd Madras then forwarded the documents to the Eastern Bank Ltd London who used to present the bill of exchange to the buyers Bank in London and upon the bill of exchange being accepted the Eastern Bank Ltd London used to deliver the bill of lading and the invoice to the buyers Bank ,FAC
8310b508257c43df855312a7c637977b,13808,13918,The buyers Bank in due course used to pay the amount of the bill of exchange to the Eastern Bank Ltd London ,FAC
65a1e383084b439f90df6c3665b25ea2,13919,14218,Thereafter on arrival of the goods and after weighment and assay the sale price was ascertained and the balance of price after deducting the payments made against the bill of exchange used to be paid to the Eastern Bank Ltd London which was the assessee company s agent and banker in London ,FAC
6b44bb9116a34ed4a76af148fb9aea43,14219,14417,On the facts stated above the Income tax Officer assessed the assessee company on the entire profits in respect of these sales on the footing that they arose and were also received in British India ,FAC
99d7a96dcd674ae38aa7a10bc8656116,14418,14491,On appeal the Appellate Assistant Commissioner confirmed the assessment ,FAC
374aa2817c28414ea23568352a61c1aa,14492,14568,The assessee company went up on appeal to the Income tax Appellate Tribunal ,FAC
2a562a118f1d4c8090b63c9447846b92,14569,14806,The Tribunal by its order dated the 22nd January 1948 came to the conclusion that the sales took place outside British India and that the money in respect of such sales was also received by the agent of the assessee company in London ,FAC
95e6bc267f724c6c8dac3b7f5e1129f1,14807,15001,The Commissioner of Income tax thereupon applied to the Appellate Tribunal requiring the latter to state a case and refer certain questions of law said to rise out of the order of the Tribunal ,FAC
e6375e4d130c42b48f2d65c231f3e473,15002,15092,The Appellate Tribunal accordingly referred the two questions of law hereinbefore set out ,FAC
58e4c133656c4654868597178e54d6d9,15093,15285,The High Court of Madras in a well reasoned judgment upheld the decision of the Appellate Tribunal and answered the two questions in the affirmative and against the Commissioner of Income tax ,FAC
d663dbacfb96456a99e8bb85aab4d55a,15286,15397,The Commissioner of Income tax has now preferredthis appeal with a certificate of fitness from the High Court ,FAC
3dfc88bb559d4ba4916a9bec712aee3a,15397,15634, It appears from the statement of case as also from the order of the Appellate Tribunal that it was agreed between the department and the assessee company that the income arose at the place wherever that be where the sales took place ,ANALYSIS
de260d0b0bcf438caf75b44b72815d58,15634,15779, This was not disputed before the High Court or before us although in the appellant s statement of case it was suggested that this was erroneous ,ANALYSIS
ad1a99919c094c858cd5630f73c5352e,15780,15856,The point for determination therefore is as to where the sales took place ,ANALYSIS
5e1124b5ab18401f89b02d8f9813f461,15857,16043,Learned Solicitor General appearing in support of this appeal contends that having regard to the terms of the contracts the sales must be regarded as having taken place in British India ,ARG_PETITIONER
6d164a95d29245bc8560d02d6fa8f17c,16044,16430,The facts strongly relied on by him are i that the price and delivery of goods were on F O B terms ii that in the European contracts the insurance if any was to be the concern of the buyers and iii that payment of the 80 per cent or 90 per cent as the case may be was made in Madras by the Eastern Bank Ltd Madras to the assessee company on the delivery of the documents ,ARG_PETITIONER
cb05f811585c46f5a21c37774c256d88,16431,16608,All these facts taken together indicate according to his submission that the property in the goods passed at Madras and the sales accordingly were completed in British India ,ARG_PETITIONER
6f8ece52992c4b05aef4f5da21a0c76f,16608,16655,We are unable to accept this line of reasoning ,ANALYSIS
16c69b745c8d41d2b6144dafc4e48be3,16656,17172,According to section 4 of the Indian Sale of Goods Act a contract of sale of goods is a contract whereby the seller transfer or agrees to transfer the property in goods to the buyer for a price and where under a contract of sale the property in the goods is transferred from the seller to the buyer the contract is called a sale but where the transfer of property in the goods is to take place at a future time or subject to some condition thereafter to be fulfilled the contract is called an agreement to sell ,STA
bce946d243b643caa067affd98c44759,17173,17362,By sub section 4 of that section an agreement to sell becomes a sale when the time elapses or the conditions are fulfilled subject to which the property in the goods is to be transferred ,STA
bc7dd4254a3940c0888a984c19d9ab1b,17362,17548, Section 18 of the Act clearly indicates that in the case of sale of unascertained goods no property in the goods is transferred to the buyer unless and until the goods are ascertained ,STA
d24ac55965ff4b6e94a53cec72f8ad14,17549,17634,In 857 the present case the contracts were always for sale of unascertained goods ,ANALYSIS
74ce286130714ec6b176354436af64b2,17635,18110,Skipping over sections 19 to 22 which deal with contract of sale of specific goods we come to section 23 which lays down that where there is a contract for the sale of unascertained or future goods by description and goods of that description and in a deliverable state are unconditionally appropriated to the contract either by the seller with the assent of the buyer or by the buyer with the assent of the seller the property in the goods thereupon passes to the buyer ,ANALYSIS
f9ed099f4bae4edfbf2b00f321369445,18111,18331,It is suggested that as soon as the assessee company placed the goods on board the steamer named by the buyer at the Madras Port the goods became ascertained and the property in the goods passed immediately to the buyer ,ANALYSIS
663beb24b30645a58c14be59156958bb,18332,18423,This argument however overlooks the important word unconditionally used in the section ,ANALYSIS
2c5ea1c7c75f42a1ba011bf6e1b77f0e,18423,18587, The requirement of the section is not only that there shall be appropriation of the goods to the contract but that such appropriation must be made unconditionally ,ANALYSIS
0f5875903ea442a5932dd840421eb0bb,18588,18916,This is further elaborated by section 25 which provides that where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods or where goods are subsequently appropriated to the contract the seller may by the terms of the contract or appropriation reserve the right of disposal of the goods until certain conditions are fulfilled ,STA
fc27b51c8255474da989022e1e7c8c90,18917,19177,In such a case notwithstanding the delivery of the goods to the buyer or to a carrier or other bailer for the purpose of transmission to the buyer the property in the goods does not pass to the buyer until the conditions imposed by the seller are fulfilled ,ANALYSIS
9cef8b725094492fb9434904f0a116c0,19178,19312,The question in this case therefore is was there an unconditional appro priation of the goods by merely placing them on the ship ,ISSUE
b9594c4ae54644f0baa8b10e336fa154,19312,19561, It is true that the price and delivery was F O B Madras but the contracts themselves clearly required the buyers to open a confirmed irrevocable Bankers credit for the requisite percentage of the invoice value to be available against documents ,ANALYSIS
a64d0a33e4a8493faa1de1e758b81b8b,19562,19776,This clearly indicated that the buyers would not be entitled to the documents that is the bill of lading and the provisional invoice until payment of the requisite percentage was made upon the bill of exchange ,ANALYSIS
6a35b56580124a3db2d79a4d4a183865,19776,19962, The bill of lading is the document of title to the goods and by this termthe assessee company clearly reserved the right of disposal of the goods until the bill of exchange as paid ,ANALYSIS
f040f01fc04f4067a5ec9f696f255be1,19963,20286,Placing of the goods on board the steamer named by the buyer under a F O B contract clearly discharges the contractual liability of the seller as seller and the delivery to the buyer is complete and the goods may thenceforward be also at the risk of the buyer against which he may cover himself by taking out an insurance ,ANALYSIS
25df718c437947ecac04420f7846e45b,20287,20772,Prima facie such delivery of the goods to the buyer and the passing of the risk in respect of the goods from the seller to the buyer are strong indications as to the passing also of the property in the goods to the buyer but they are not decisive and may be negatived for under section 25 the seller may yet reserve to himself the right of disposal of the goods until the fulfilment of certain conditions and thereby prevent the passing of property in the goods from him to the buyer ,ANALYSIS
cc86427a54dd418fa760b18085d65350,20773,20894,The facts found in this case are that the assessee company shipped the goods under bill of lading issued in its own name ,ANALYSIS
70cc2f865056452b8d325e7bb31838ff,20895,21131,Under the contract it was not obliged to part with the bill of lading which is the document of title to the goods until the bill of exchange drawn by it on the buyers Bank where the irrevocable letter of credit was opened was honoured ,ANALYSIS
29b2359486cb411b9c4f7aec57f061e2,21132,21486,It is urged that under the provision in the contract for weighment and assay which was ultimately to fix the price unless the buyer rightly rejected the goods as not being in terms of the contract the passing of property in the goods could not take place until the buyer accepted the goods and the price was fully ascertained after weighment and assay ,ANALYSIS
b79af6e0882a4b2f8daa4e6a10e5d03d,21487,21754,It is submitted that being the position the property in the goods passed and the sales were concluded outside British India for the weighment sampling assay and the final fixation of the price could only take place under all these contracts outside British India ,ANALYSIS
0ac33889aec3446ca77a62bfebbceff5,21755,21832,It is not necessary for us to express any opinion on this extreme contention ,ANALYSIS
36dd6061889341da82116c3c60e59dc9,21833,22260,Suffice it to say for the purposes of this case that in any event upon the terms of the contracts in question and the course of dealings between the parties the property in the goods could not have passed to the buyer earlier than the date when the bill of exchange was accepted by the buyers Bank in London and thedocuments were delivered by the assessee company s agent the Eastern Bank Ltd London to the buyers Bank ,ANALYSIS
1916e9c55ddf4cf1a10584aacde79b1e,22261,22347,This admittedly and as found by the Appellate Tribunal always took place in London ,ANALYSIS
decc76fb36304b0aa36b67f470ba2267,22348,22558,It must therefore follow that at the earliest the property in the goods passed in London where the bill of lading was handed over to the buyers Bank against the acceptance of the relative bill of exchange ,ANALYSIS
007910f4349c43edacd16d1570c30212,22559,22786,In the premises the Appellate Tribunal as well as the High Court were quite correct in holding that the sales took place outside British India and ex hypothesis the profits derived from such sales arose outside British India ,ANALYSIS
11eacaa4da15426fa617cba7cef4bac3,22786,22983, As to the second question the learned Solicitor General contends that irrespective of the place where the sale may have taken place the profits derived from such sales were received in Madras ,ARG_PETITIONER
991f11a3ab424f4a8dbc0d4596f6e736,22984,23349,It is recalled that after shipment the assessee company through its managing agent in Madras prepared provisional invoices and drew bills of exchange for 80 per cent or 90 per cent as the case may be of the amount of such invoices and handed over the same to the Eastern Bank Ltd Madras and received the amount of the bill of exchange from them in Madras ,ARG_PETITIONER
6afc317ab75146c49b35d461e2282ba1,23350,23513,He contends that the receipt of this payment by the assessee company was really the receipt of the price of the goods and amounted to receipt of profits in Madras ,ARG_PETITIONER
87d4c5243ade48cc8b3b243b20994124,23514,23777,He draws our attention to the terms of payment in the European contract and to the letter of intimation of the opening of the credit sent by the Eastern Bank Ltd Madras to the assessee company which have been quoted in part in the earlier part of this judgment ,ARG_PETITIONER
6b1ea3de1d494fc6aa3e1992875d280a,23778,23928,He relies on the words through the Eastern Bank Ltd appearing in the contract and the words available by delivery to us appearing in the letter ,ARG_PETITIONER
ca0096050c6b49aab403c5bf6b86b014,23929,24018,We do not think that those words support the contention of the learned Solicitor General ,ANALYSIS
8a4b28a0ac9847608f08760366a3651a,24019,24277,The words through the Eastern Bank Ltd appear to us to go with the preceding words to be advised to sellers which are put within brackets which seem to have been wrongly closed after the word sellers instead of after the words the Eastern Bank Ltd ,ANALYSIS
8c2dde4ff0084f4583688e5fd0a55987,24278,24362,Ordinarily the buyer opens a letter of credit with his Bank in favour of the seller,ANALYSIS
0923556dcb984a649f9fb478b1a9375b,24363,24714,andthe words through the Eastern Bank Ltd would be meaningless unless it was intended to mean that the irrevocable credit which was in favour of the assessee company was to be operated upon by the latter through the Eastern Bank Ltd If that were the true meaning then that certainly does not make the Eastern Bank Ltd the agent of the buyers ,ANALYSIS
0422f990483e49d7abcf81b346dda77f,24715,24905,The words available by delivery to us occurring in the letter of the Eastern Bank Ltd Madras do not appear to us to indicate that this was any part of the terms of the letter of credit ,ANALYSIS
4e2e8aab27cb49acb8a9d3090c045bb6,24906,25170,This was an intimation in accordance with the advice received by the Eastern Bank Ltd Madras from the Eastern Bank Ltd London that the assessee company might avail itself of the letter of credit by delivery of the documents to the Eastern Bank Ltd Madras ,ANALYSIS
173b61a58b4d4363b002198690a214d3,25171,25412,This is made further clear by the latter part of the letter where the Eastern Bank Ltd Madras expressed their willingness at their option to negotiate the drafts drawn in terms of the arrangement provided that the documents were in order ,ANALYSIS
5a0008c776394411b5a9237b7529eae9,25413,25616,The concluding sentence of that letter whereby the Eastern Bank Ltd Madras disown any responsibility in respect of the advice clearly militates against the suggestion of the learned Solicitor General ,ANALYSIS
815b45c5ac0b4fdd8741af7a2371efa6,25617,25868,It is in these circumstances impossible to accede to the argument that the payment of 80 per cent or 90 per cent as the case may be of the amount of the provisional invoice by the Eastern Bank Ltd Madras was a payment on account of the price ,ANALYSIS
5ef2d6eb6e9b4bf8a7b21bb099fb6b33,25869,25922,Normally price is paid by or on behalf of the buyer ,ANALYSIS
db88aca8fb844cbe9cd89836fcbee6e3,25923,26062,In this case the fact found is that the Eastern Bank Ltd Madras and the Eastern Bank Ltd London were agents of the assessee company ,ANALYSIS
42798689431046a79671d9aed5f1627b,26063,26114,Neither of them had any relation with the buyers ,ANALYSIS
534bd50923aa4e6696e2b9adf138ac1c,26115,26189,Therefore a payment by them cannot be regarded as a payment of the price ,ANALYSIS
012f4d804cf74a2fa4d8a94e72e36194,26190,26593,The true position is very clearly put by Lord Sumner in The Prinz Adalbert 1 When a shipper takes his draft not as yet accepted but accompanied by a bill of lading indorsed in this way and discounts it with a banker he makes himself liable on the instrument as drawer and he further makes the goods which the bill of lading 1 L R 1917 A C 586 589 represents security for its payment ,PRE_RELIED
a4ca9ed985de4ecabe4ab7cc93409a19,26594,26930,If in turn the discounting banker surrenders the bill of lading to the acceptor against his acceptance the inference is that he is satisfied to part with his security in consideration of getting this further party s liability on the bill and that in so doing he acts with the permission and by the mandate of the shipper and drawer ,PRE_RELIED
d6fc820530bf499bafc79050d8b6bd1e,26930,27303, This payment by the Eastern Bank Ltd Madras therefore is nothing but an advance made by them to their own customer on the security of the goods covered by the bill of lading reinforced by the benefit of the liability taken up by the assessee company as drawer of the bill which in its turn is backed by the confirmed and irrevocable credit of the buyers London Bank ,ANALYSIS
c3552435ad58499d947fca9be8e19cb0,27304,27486,If this payment was on account of the price why should the assessee company as the seller undertake any liability to the Eastern Bank Ltd as the drawer of the bill of exchange ,ANALYSIS
e53c4f3ace414580b5e6dd36538ba112,27487,27682,The truth of the matter is that the price was paid on behalf of the buyers by their respective London Banks in London to the Eastern Bank Ltd London which was the agent of the assessee company ,ANALYSIS
6da70085380e4de5a5668ee810db4593,27683,27823,The first receipt of the price therefore as pointed out by the High Court was by the Eastern Bank Ltd London on behalf of the sellers ,ANALYSIS
e1325816491147c09533479d2a00f960,27824,28067,There is no dispute that the balance of the price ascertained after weighment and assay and deducting the amount paid on the bill of exchange was similarly received in London by the Eastern Bank Ltd London on behalf of the assessee company ,ANALYSIS
f0d4f2718af5492e872b317ea8f5eb86,28068,28203,The subsequent adjustment made in the books of the Eastern Bank Ltd London did not operate as a receipt of profits in British India ,ANALYSIS
22b69d6494e04f7ea5febf73f1e6c3d5,28204,28312,In our opinion the High Court correctly answered the second question also in favour of the assessee company ,RATIO

bde0bba4293a4df9aef8ee22cf77352e,10533,10795, 15 The main plank of the submission of the Revenue before the CIT A which has been adverted to by the ITAT in the impugned order is the decision of the DB of this Court in Consolidated Photo and Finvest Ltd v Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax supra ,ANALYSIS
46605902b90b405595d6bc275b5b67a1,10796,10869,In particular reliance is placed on the following observations 19 ,ANALYSIS
070bea6733fc49de82f0c1b14e732093,10869,10985,The argument that the proposed reopening of assessment was based only upon a change of opinion has not impressed us ,ANALYSIS
fe950a37b5a4453a9b2ff1dfeb4f4998,10986,11149,The assessment order did not admittedly address itself to the question which the assessing officer proposes to examine in the course of re assessment proceedings ,ANALYSIS
5223fd52b1a148f888623bdb84257ccf,11150,11480,The submission of Mr Vohra that even when the order of assessment did not record any explicit opinion on the aspects now sought to be examined it must be presumed that those aspects were present to the mind of the assessing officer and had been held in favour of the assessee is too farfetched a proposition to merit acceptance ,ANALYSIS
e92e7054272849dda59cca1337a7ee4c,11481,11767,There may indeed be a presumption that the assessment proceedings have been regularly conducted but there can be no presumption that even when the order of assessment is silent all possible angles and aspects of a controversy had been examined and determined by the assessing officer ,ANALYSIS
a74cab4d462d457aafd45f1c80bf7c1a,11768,11897,It is trite that a matter in issue can be validly determined only upon application of mind by the authority determining the same ,ANALYSIS
876fd984cb5b4be7b2c32c95bd12d4ba,11898,12052,Application of mind is in turn best demonstrated by disclosure of mind which is best done by giving reasons for the view which the authority is taking ,ANALYSIS
089789eb2a644f76bc202953bd371a86,12053,12281,In cases where the order passed by a statutory authority is silent as to the reasons for the conclusion it has drawn it can well be said that the authority has not applied its mind to the issue before it nor formed any opinion ,ANALYSIS
91d4a05f2d07488597d2ec2af6168ff0,12282,12530,The principle that a mere change of opinion cannot be a basis for reopening computed assessments would be applicable only to situations where the assessing officer has applied his mind and taken a conscious decision on a particular matter in issue ,ANALYSIS
d6efb2847d6a4b7ab8bdd8e4974f243d,12531,12718,It will have no application where the order of assessment does not address itself to the aspect which is the basis for reopening of the assessment as is the position in the present case ,ANALYSIS
b25481a26a2d4fc28056d8b0d385fd7d,12719,12942,It is in that view inconsequential whether or not the material necessary for taking a decision was available to the assessing officer either generally or in the form of a reply to the questionnaire served upon the assessed ,ANALYSIS
66c84ee69a6e4bdf8b7c3092780afd7a,12943,13050,What is important is whether the assessing officer had based on the material available to him taken a view ,ANALYSIS
0bd0265b5ad7472b868c339df4e5026e,13051,13186,If he had not done so the proposed reopening cannot be assailed on the ground that the same is based only on a change of opinion 16 ,ANALYSIS
81e90fcc47874cc78414134ad3c80222,13187,13506,The fact of the matter is that later Benches of this Court including two Full Benches in CIT v Kelvinator of India Ltd supra and CIT v Usha International Ltd 2012 348 ITR 485 have disagreed with the view expressed by the DB in Consolidated Photo and Finvest Ltd v Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax supra ,ANALYSIS

6abfc5e00dfd4074944a10ec3dc3662c,14893,15144,In these circumstances the decision of the Division Bench in Consolidated Photo and Finvest Ltd v Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax inasmuch as it is irreconcilable with the views of the Full Bench must be held not to lay down the correct law ,ANALYSIS
d52f0fda8ed046d186f3cc37ef8de06b,15145,15299,This is especially so since the assessment proceedings had not come to an end under the first sub section of Section 143 but under the third Sub section ,ANALYSIS
1851188d2be44e1297e518e81ed70765,15300,15725,A Division Bench of a particular High Court is fully bound by the view preferred by a larger Bench of that Court regardless of the fact that another High Court prefers a different view in this case that of the Gujarat High Court as in Gruh Finance Ltd v Joint Commissioner of Income Tax Assessment Praful Chunilal Patel v M J Makwana Assistant CIT and Garden Silk Mills Ltd v Deputy CIT No 1 ,ANALYSIS
cb7af0bea2ad4a17bbe1bd33ae23757f,15726,15840,The Full Bench of this Court has taken into consideration both Praful Chunilal Patel as well as Garden Silk Mills ,ANALYSIS
c1d6e851f5024377b9d26976db2685a8,15840,16241, In Kelvinator the Full Bench had also analysed the earlier Division Bench decisions namely Jindal Photo Films Ltd v Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax presided over by R C Lahoti J as learned Chief Justice of India then was and Bawa Abhai Singh v Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax 2002 253 ITR 83 comprising Arijit Pasayat and D K Jain JJ as their Lordships then were ,ANALYSIS
1eecc1c859f64bc2b349bed00e56a2fd,16242,16512,It is quite possible that had the Court in Consolidated Photo been made aware of the consistent opinion of this Court in Jindal Photo and Bawa Abhai Singh their conclusion may have been totally different notwithstanding alternative view of the Gujarat High Court 18 ,ANALYSIS
547766d30e244a6c8bd64ef80ca3294c,16513,16691,There is no manner of doubt that the decision of the DB of this Court in Consolidated Photo and Finvest Ltd v Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax supra is no longer good law ,ANALYSIS
bf61dec3d6684576add64a143d441176,16692,16765,The main plank of the Revenue s case before this Court therefore fails ,ANALYSIS
e8e73c10747c45ae9311b15badc37aa9,16766,16895,Nevertheless the Court proceeds to examine the question of validity of the reopening of the assessments for the AYs in question ,ANALYSIS
ccb82cb3bd4b4cdf9718da947f2c8e82,16895,17061, 19 The fact of the matter is that during the course of the original assessments under Section 143 3 the AO did serve upon the Assessee a detailed questionnaire ,ANALYSIS

9cb47944c54545228cc17f56f8832d83,17383,17507,In the circumstances the view taken by a successor AO on the same material was indeed nothing but a mere change of opinion ,ANALYSIS
9ab313a0bae24c21af3de2167523b2d6,17508,17947,It is a well settled legal proposition as explained in Calcutta Discount Co Ltd v ITO 1961 41 ITR 191 SC that once an Assessee has discharged the burden of not only producing the account books and other documents but also the specific material relevant to the assessment it is for the Income tax Officer to draw the proper inferences of fact and law therefrom and the Assessee cannot further be called upon to do so for him ,ANALYSIS

2d950c15c9f847e09ef8fc582ef26f86,3865,4116,This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment of the Bombay High Court in a writ petition challenging the notice issued under s 34 1 of the Indian Income tax Act 1922 by the First Income tax Officer Bombay who is the appellant before us ,FAC
4b1a3ff3ce2140609d151a58e8abaadf,4117,4243,In the writ petition various grounds were urged by the respondent in support of the convention that the notice was bad in law ,FAC
9a66c55471a747a8b20d478dd20420c2,4243,4465, The High Court however dealt with only one of those contentions accepted it and did not permit the respon dents counsel Mr Mehta to put forward the other conten tions urged in the writ petition by the respondents ,FAC
7b910171d9ec45b8a7461f1a73f28ee1,4465,4635, The appellant had issued notice to the respondents under s 34 1 a of the Income tax Act in respect of an escaped income of Rs 47 595 for the assessment year 1944 45 ,FAC
624bfd23f90e402fa195100ed1dd2267,4636,4684,This notice was issued by him on March 27 1957 ,FAC
f40606737b824477bec6cf5d2a21c796,4685,5070,On behalf of the respondents it is contended that the notice was bad because though it was in respect of an amount of less than Rs 1 lakh it was issued after the expiry of the assessment year and that the sanction of the Central Board of Revenue for issuing that notice had not been obtained by the Income tax Officer as required by cl iii of the proviso to s 34 1 of the Act ,FAC
485bd6931f6e49398239304e10cec7c2,5071,5138,It is not disputed before us that the case falls under s 34 1 a ,ANALYSIS
c821caadf6bc4442a9ce33d636badb1c,5139,6202,That provision reads thus 1 If a the Income tax Officer has reason to believe that by reason of the omission of failure on the part of an assessee to make a return of his income under section 22 for any year or to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for that year income profits or gains chargeable to income tax have escaped assessment for that year or have been under assessed or assessed at too low a rate or have been made the subject of excessive relief under the Act or excessive loss or depre ciation allowance has been computed or he may in cases falling under clause a at any time serve on the assessee a notice containing all or any of the require ments which may be included in a notice under sub section 2 of section 22 and may proceed to assess or re assess such income profits or gains or recompute the loss or depreciation allowance and the provisions of this Act shall so far as may be apply accordingly as if the notice were a notice issued under that subsection ,STA
bc9fc8f4cf2046fa8c87aac34c13c081,6202,6243,We have quoted only the relevant portion ,ANALYSIS
738db849b7b74b8bab2586faa1c4639c,6244,7411,Then follows the first proviso which runs thus provided that the Income tax Officer shall not issue a notice under clause a of sub section 1 i for any year prior to the year ending on the 31st day of March 1941 ii for any year if eight years have elapsed after the expiry of that year unless the income profits or gains chargeable to income tax which have escaped assessment or have been underassessed or assessed at too low a rate or have been made the subject of excessive relief under this Act or the loss or depreciation allowance which has been computed in excess amount to or are likely to amount to one lakh of rupees or more in the aggregate either for that year or for that year and any other year or years after which or after each of which eight years have elapsed not being a year or years ending be fore the 31st day of March 1941 iii for any year unless he has recorded his reasons for doing so and in any case falling under clause ii unless the Central Board of Revenue and in any other case the Commissioner is satisfied on such reasons recorded that it is a fit case for the issue of such notice ,STA
15b6a905918a42d0a391a0e1b1e4792f,7411,7746,It will thus be seen that where the Income tax Officer has reason to believe that due to any act of the assessee a full and accurate declaration was not made by the assessee for any year with the result that part of his income has escap ed assessment for that year the Income tax Officer may issue a notice under cl a at any time ,ANALYSIS
1f272cd097724b64ba16770b218c247d,7748,7915,The respondents contention before the High Court was that the notice was bad because it had not complied with the two conditions laid down in the proviso to s 34 1 ,ANALYSIS
9afb35f0bc974883916660a71c3b193e,7916,8405,Adverting to this contention the High Court has observed thus Before the amendment of this section which was in force on the 27th March 1957 the period of limitation of eight years was provided with regard to the issue of notices under Section 34 1 a and a period of four years for cases falling under Section 34 1 b By the amendment the period of limitation was removed and the Legislature provided that if the case fell under Section 34 1 a a notice can be served at any time ,ANALYSIS
19ca196917bf4199a8525d33df6a2004,8406,8585,But while removing any bar of limitation the Legislature provided some safeguards for the assessee and these safeguards were three in number and they were set out in the proviso ,ANALYSIS
88553261810a4eb3ac16bdbfef7b86c3,8586,9081,The first safeguard was that a notice shall not be issued for any year prior to the year ending on the 31st day of March 1941 the second safeguard was that if eight years had elapsed then the notice should not be issued for an escaped income which aggregated to less than one lakh of rupees and the third safeguard was that the Central Board of Revenue had to be satisfied on reasons to be recorded that this was a fit case for the issue of a notice which was for a period beyond eight years ,ANALYSIS
dcca95c2a7704058951e66f3ac7c8276,9107,9271,Now admittedly this notice is for an amount which is less than a lakh of rupees and admittedly the Central Board of Revenue has not considered this matter at all ,ANALYSIS
44223def30eb453f88391a6a03ae8552,9272,9581,Therefore there does not seem to be any answer to the contention put forward by the petitioner The High Court is right in saying that a notice cannot be issued where the income which has escaped assessment is less than a lakh of rupees and where more than eight years have elapsed from the assessment year ,ANALYSIS
cc85df83651a4955a017c60ca0f76b74,9582,9711,To this however there is one exception and that is where the matter would fall to be governed by the second proviso to s 34 3 ,ANALYSIS
acad7bba79f148389d1f2f2570bf60d6,9712,9763,To this aspect we will however come little later ,ANALYSIS
2142f5ea8e0e4e7895638c9c3fe1d0df,9764,9901,But before that what we must consider is the view of the High Court that the sanction of the Central Board of Revenue was also necessary ,ANALYSIS
b69c09502aec470e8df37ea24568ee2f,9902,10087,Under cl iii of the proviso to s 34 1 a notice can issue only if the Central Board of Revenue is satisfied with the reasons recorded by the Income tax Officer for issuing a notice ,ANALYSIS
a3c1ba83b89846cebc406ed0d851ffbc,10088,10179,For convenience we are describing this process as sanction of the Central Board of Revenue ,ANALYSIS
9c1f4f5eb47848fe96fdea7d2e21d9c3,10180,10308,The sanction under this clause is however necessary only where the notice in question is issued under cl ii of the proviso ,ANALYSIS
11f99904a50e41d7ba82a3b9896edfd0,10309,10407,That is evidently what the Legislature meant when it says in any case falling under clause ii ,ANALYSIS
526a6754093d4f01af3d1481694a19bf,10408,10576,For cl ii has to be read with the opening words of the proviso Provided that the Income tax Officer shall not issue a notice under clause a of sub section 1 ,ANALYSIS
feccc11f8c21447f9f655be89df37c44,10577,10711,So read it will be clear that the words in any case used in cl iii only mean a case in which notice can be issued under cl ii ,ANALYSIS
71aefe6d15fb4294b0b7e096ed3520b7,10712,10803,Such a notice can be issued only when the escaped income is of one lakh of rupees and over ,ANALYSIS
3b0bee3560504356a6c3ffde948820c6,10803,11118, It was however contended by Mr Shroff that cl ii of the proviso dealt not only with the escaped assessment of one lakh of rupees and over but also with assessments which were less than one lakh of rupees and that therefore even in the present case the sanction of the Central Board of Revenue was required ,ANALYSIS
228f52eeb27a460ca27eab8ca06485d7,11119,11297,By excluding action with respect to escaped assessment of less than one lakh of rupees cl ii can in one sense be regarded as dealing with escaped assessments of this kind ,ANALYSIS
be18fe5365b84ff383067b0cdc29ec19,11298,11475,But it would be wrong to say that because of this cl iii requires the obtaining of the sanction of the Central Board of Revenue for a notice to be issued with respect to it ,ANALYSIS
165b4a59339d40da9b6b7633e1338423,11476,11772,As already pointed out cl iii requires such sanction where the notice is issued under cl ii and when on a construction of cl ii no notice can be issued with respect to a class of escaped assessments there can possibly be no requirement of the sanction of the Central Board of Revenue ,ANALYSIS
4187664b83d242539ccb60058f904a2d,11773,12067,If a notice is issued by virtue of some other provision such as the second proviso to sub s 3 of s 34 it would be a notice in any other case referred to in cl iii of the proviso to sub s 1 of s 34 and in such a case the sanction which isrequired is only that of the Commissioner ,ANALYSIS
ec0a058a33de429eaa8845c20ca7b910,12068,12237,Such a sanction was obtained in this case and therefore the notice cannot be said to be bad because the sanction of the Central Board of Revenue has not been obtained ,ANALYSIS
9d19ef6cacbc4c8fadd8f87d89d572b6,12238,12290,Now we will come to the other aspect of the matter ,ANALYSIS
8bcc09706ced466d90a0576fb8ec8e9e,12290,12592, Limitation is no doubt placed upon the power of the Income tax Officer by cl ii of the first proviso which says that if eight years have elapsed after the expiry of that year no such notice can issue unless the income which has escaped assessment is likely to amount to one lakh of rupees or more ,ANALYSIS
0d16d95452574a7bb6d95b5d547026e7,12593,12811,Here admittedly the income which has escaped assessment is below one lakh of rupees and more than eight years have elapsed since the assessment year in respect of which the income is alleged to have escaped assessment ,ANALYSIS
fcf1881a9ef7441e805a4b86ee5eaa35,12811,12868, Clearly therefore no notice could issue under cl ii ,ANALYSIS
031effc9b41142d19ff719a4feac73bb,12868,13000, The answer given by the Income tax Officer however is that limitation is taken away by the second proviso to sub s 3 of s 34 ,ANALYSIS
fafc3630171d4d95ac85b6121883fec5,13001,13054,We would quote s 34 3 and the second proviso to it ,STA
0d7253b2b6cd4779bb394cd23da7a171,13055,13945,They run thus No order of assessment or reassessment other than an order of assessment under section 23 to which clause c of sub section 1 of section 28 applies or an order of assessment or reassessment in cases falling within clause a of sub section 1 or sub section A of this section shall be made after the expiry of four years from the end of the year in which the income profits or gains were first assessable Provided further that nothing contained in this seetion limiting the time within which any action may be taken or any order assessment or reassessment may be made shall apply to a reassessment made under section 27 or to an assessment or re assessment made on the assessee or any person in consequence of or to give effect to any finding or direction contained in an order under section 31 section 33 section 33A section 33B section 66 or section 66A The,STA

70ad78814b3e47419e9d321ce45a32c9,13953,14145,proviso to s 34 3 could be pressed in aid by the Income tax Officer because in issuing the notice he was giving effect to a direction contained in the order of a nigher Income tax authority ,ANALYSIS
34bc20ba6b2149ddac7e57e14adc905e,14145,14698, Dealing with this matter the High Court has observed as follows in its judgment Now when there was a limitation of eight years under section 34 1 a the second proviso to Section 34 3 has to be resorted Section 34 3 had to be resorted to by the Income tax Department if it wanted to issue a notice after the period of limitation and a notice after eight years in a case falling under section 34 1 a could only be issued provided it was a result of a direction contained in an order passed by an Income tax Authority ,ANALYSIS
ffa4d7e9bce64647b1d74e04b71d0010,14699,14855,But by reason of the recent amendment the question of limitation does not arise but the Legislature has provided certain safeguards as already pointed out ,ANALYSIS
ddd53713445d4bd0adc54e4bcaae872d,14855,15138, Therefore whether a notice is issued as a result of a direction contained in any order of an Income tax Authority or not if it is a notice which is issued beyond eight years the notice must satisfy the conditions laid down in the proviso to Section 34 1 ,ANALYSIS
635f5b697ded4d7cb50d6ebd0d95373a,15139,15296,Therefore the result is that in some respects the law has been made more rigorous against the assessee and in other respects it has been made more lenient ,ANALYSIS
843495a26dae4eb5b09eab43549ae758,15297,15526,Before the amendment a notice could be issued after eight years in respect of any escaped income whatever the amount provided the notice was issued to give effect to a direction contained in an order of an Income tax Authority ,ANALYSIS
a874735cb4e141aaa5a933bfe8abd06a,15527,15586,Now a direction is not necessary for the issue of a notice ,ANALYSIS
3cc89100c3df44e7a7620347107c843d,15587,15900,But as against that an assessee whose escaped income is not a lakh of rupees is completely protected and even though there may be a direction contained in an order of an Income tax Authority no notice can be issued against the assessee if the escaped income is less than a lakh of rupees ,ANALYSIS
14716f0178ce49d38bc195879950737d,15901,16060,Therefore on the one hand the assessee whose escaped income is less than a lakh of rupees is now put in a better position than he was before the amend ment ,ANALYSIS
dbae6ada0dcc431db948e29c5612a440,16061,16325,The assessee whose escaped income is more than a lakh of rupees is put in a worse position because he can be proceeded against even without a direction contained in an order of an Income tax Authority provided the Cen tral Board of Revenue has applied its mind to,ANALYSIS

b4da9c26df5d408e8b9cdf2c319dbd26,16570,16731,Apparently the High Court has overlooked the fact that the second proviso to sub s 3 of s 34 was amended first by Act 25 of 1953 and then by Act 18 of 1956 ,ANALYSIS
b01f583789584973978582aac8da724b,16732,17008,As it stood prior to these amendments it read thus Provided further that nothing contained in this subsection shall apply to a re assessment made under section 27 or in pursuance of an order under section 31 section 33 section 33A section 33B section 66 or section 66A ,ANALYSIS

0503d43f9b46414e8aacd46e8d2689d1,17510,17679,The result in our opinion would be the same even if the case were to fall to be governed by the Amending Act of 1953 though not by that of the Amending Act of 1956 We,ANALYSIS

d6e95c3d2a2940899a173b21d7642a05,18175,18467, As we have pointed out earlier at the beginning of the judgment the learned Judges confined their attention prac tically only to the construction of proviso iii to s 34 1 which was decided in favolur of the respondents and did not permit them to argue the other points raised by them ,RATIO

d11070c63e964e2e93d92ae2af976aec,8074,8424,The reasoning adopted in the two years for which the re opening is being sought after four years from the end of the relevant assessment year was that since the petitioner had answered Not Applicable with regard to serial No 14 ii e of form 10 CCB the petitioner had failed to disclose full and true material facts necessary for his assessment ,ARG_PETITIONER
2fb80fa558c84972832325e40fd07bda,8425,8751,Apart from this the learned counsel for the petitioner also drew our attention to the assessment order dated 29 3 2007 pertaining to the assessment year 2005 06 wherein the assessing officer had allowed the deduction claimed by the petitioner and had specifically noted as under the assessee has filed necessary evidences ,ARG_PETITIONER
64361abccebd4c7eb9e71761c071de6f,8752,9057,It was also pointed out by the learned counsel that prior to the completion of the assessment several letters including the letters dated 27 12 2006 13 03 2007 and 23 03 2007 had been written by the petitioner to the assessing officer explaining inter alia the claim for deduction under section 80 IC ,ARG_PETITIONER
b46528bf4ce745188bec8e0774691be5,9058,9232,The learned counsel for the petitioner also drew our attention to the objections which were taken by the petitioner to the purported reasons for re opening of the assessment ,ARG_PETITIONER
258639d8fdad49cc88d088ae1331269e,9233,9676,In the objections the petitioner had specifically taken the plea that the 13th schedule of the said Act and particularly serial No 20 thereof has been misrepresented by the revenue inasmuch as it has not realized that the product manufactured by the petitioner fell within the heading no 39 23 and was therefore not in the negative list which dealt with articles falling within headings 39 09 to 39 15 of the Central Excise Classification ,ARG_PETITIONER
4f3abd56ae864b4eb90ab3b4948f842b,9677,9872,Unfortunately this aspect of the matter has not been dealt with appropriately if at all by the assessing officer in the order dated 17 02 2012 rejecting the objections raised by the petitioner ,ARG_PETITIONER
71fa5f4b0f48423d9d89f47b4a6dca60,9872,10055, 9 We have also heard the learned counsel for the respondent who has supported the issuance of the notices as also the purported reasons and the order rejecting the objections ,ARG_RESPONDENT
16c325a7f4ba4431a0fb17b687e3e0a0,10056,10158,However we are inclined to agree with the submissions made by the learned counsel for the petitioner ,ANALYSIS
e6917703c9d84a63953760a8bfc73c6c,10159,10386,The entire sub stratum of the notices issued under section 148 of the said Act is that the petitioner s product namely PET bottles fall within the negative list stipulated in serial No 20 of the 13th schedule of the said Act ,ANALYSIS
7800bab48cae4c428807fb044d1d0224,10387,10701,We have noted the arguments of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the product manufactured by them falls under 3923 30 90 of the Central Excise Classification which is not within the range of products specified in serial No 20 of the 13th schedule of the said Act that is within headings 39 09 to 39 15 ,ANALYSIS
32c8a494b2fd449b879f8ca5fafd73a3,10702,10793, Therefore clearly the submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner is correct ,ANALYSIS
dd953a6c6dba477391099ddde4481099,10794,10906,The petitioner s product does not fall within the negative list stipulated in the 13th schedule of the said Act ,ANALYSIS
5220ecbc22f0415a83a283e767600831,10907,11070,If that be the case then the answer given by the petitioner in serial No 14 ii e of form 10 CCB filed along with the return is not wrong false or inaccurate ,ANALYSIS
3b3e2defc59440e8b5b9b641f9849fe3,11071,11203,Therefore the petitioner cannot be held to have failed to fully and truly disclose all material facts necessary for its assessment ,ANALYSIS
7db7ef79d8d64dbf88b09230dedc7974,11203,11366, 10 Insofar as the other assessment years are concerned where the issue of limitation of four years does not arise the position would not be any different ,ANALYSIS
7f59dc1f850d4dce9de176f6c39fe7a0,11366,11930, This would be so because on a reasonable interpretation of the provisions of section 80 IC 2 read with serial No 20 of the 13th schedule of the said Act read with the first schedule to the Central Excise Tariff Act 1985 it would be clear that the petitioner s product does not fall within the negative list and therefore the petitioner had rightly claimed deduction under section 80 IC of the said Act which the assessing officer in the years in which the assessment had been completed under section 143 3 had allowed after examining the necessary evidence ,ANALYSIS
e24e8ef824e347529f40f36f43f17efa,11931,12286,Even in respect of the year in which there was no assessment order under section 143 3 that is the assessment year 2007 08 we feel that the same cannot be re opened because no reasonable person can be attributed with any reason to believe that income had escaped assessment when the petitioner s product clearly does not fall within the negative list ,ANALYSIS
a5ca149e3b764657bfe3665f6f541873,12287,12479,Thus in view of the established facts in this case the assessing officer could not even have taken the prima facie view that there were reasons to believe that income had escaped assessment ,RATIO
42e1d547250d4ec1ba63cdb3a1dc1c00,12480,12643, Consequently we feel that in the facts and circumstances of this case the issuance of notices under section 148 of the said Act was not warranted ,RATIO

84026af6081f427ea4c04c4514169531,23138,23448, 22 As such the learned trial Court should not have based conviction of the appellants for the offence punishable under Section 498A read with Section 34 of the Indian penal Code only on the basis of the letters produced by father of the deceased which according to him were written to him by his daughter ,ANALYSIS
8721313dfe50426faef3bb11e30b8a8e,23449,23594,The learned trial Court should have asked for better evidence or at least proof of the fact that the letters were in handwriting of the deceased ,ANALYSIS

f8fa022ba1694fb8b01440e9467919b1,1898,2514, 4 According to the petitioner during the pendency of the said petition and the application filed by the respondent on 01042016 she was illegally prevented from entering the matrimonial house and that gave rise to cause of action for her to claim Restitution of Conjugal Rights and to claim certain reliefs under the Act of 2005 5 Accordingly on 14062016 the petitioner filed an application for permission to file counterclaim for restitution of conjugal rights and for reliefs under the provisions of the Act of 2005 claiming that she had been thrown out of the matrimonial house from 01042016 onwards ,FAC
3758ef0a1cbf418a9013b993d8de5d18,2515,2562,This application was opposed by the respondent ,FAC
584ae3cc2c574592a1528ed74f158f00,2562,2990, 6 By the impugned order dated 27072016 the Family Court has rejected the application filed by the petitioner on the ground that under Order VIII Rule 6A of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 CPC the petitioner ought to have raised her counterclaim either along with the written statement or within the period of limitation prescribed for raising her defence in response to the petition of divorce filed by the respondent ,RLC
5490f4525ff54f2ab21248763ba55cf3,2991,3271,It was found by the Family Court that since the written statement was already filed by the petitioner and the limitation for filing counterclaim under Order VIII Rule 6A of the CPC had expired she could not raise any claim towards Restitution of Conjugal Rights as sought by her ,RLC
c3aff02043d54acf972922ad131fcf4a,3272,3465,As regards the relief sought to be claimed by the petitioner in the pending proceeding it was observed by the Family Court that under Section 26 of the Act of 2005 the petitioner could do so ,RLC
163773f4d1cd4394a3a97af448351ded,3466,3619,But since the Family Court found that the right to raise a counterclaim by the petitioner was barred by limitation the entire application was rejected ,RLC
c528ef161f584c2abed0885050cb2290,3619,4146, 7 Mrs Jyoti Dharmadhikari learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner submitted that the impugned order passed by the Family Court was unsustainable because on application of Section 23A of the Hindu Marriage Act 1955 for short Act of 1955 read with Section 21 thereof it was evident that the limitation prescribed under Order VIII Rule 6A of the CPC for raising counterclaim would not apply in the present proceedings before the Family Court initiated by the respondent under the provisions of the Act of 1955 ,ARG_PETITIONER
04172164fa53492ca3bc460dfbab3cdb,4147,4350,It was submitted that Section 21 of the Act of 1955 clearly states that subject to other provisions of the Act of 1955 all proceedings under the said Act would be regulated as far as may be by the CPC ,ARG_PETITIONER
cf8f5b73fbd94afeae99612f12e08a6c,4351,4605,It was submitted that since Section 23A of the Act of 1955 specifically provided for right to raise a counterclaim and no limitation was prescribed for the same the Family Court could not have rejected the application filed on behalf of the petitioner ,ARG_PETITIONER
2718a58c35bc499488b78c7477f579db,4606,4752,Reliance was placed on judgment of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in the case of Sameeran Roy vs Smt Leena Roy reported at AIR 2001 MP 192 8 ,ARG_PETITIONER
ad3dba3071684cbbb042225a939987b9,4752,5093,On the other hand Mr Sudhir Dhurway learned Counsel appearing for the respondent submitted that the Family Court was justified in rejecting the application of the petitioner because the counterclaim if any ought to have been raised along with written statement or within the limitation as prescribed under Order VIII Rule 6A of the CPC ,ARG_RESPONDENT
891769ff66114cd5ba650945b1f3c2ee,5094,5333,It was sought to be argued that the reliefs claimed by the petitioner under the provisions of the Act of 2005 could not have been entertained by the Family Court and that such reliefs ought to have been claimed before the Criminal Courts ,ARG_RESPONDENT

d57cdb233fd84d7ab78715a64635b503,5474,5837,The only question that arises for consideration in this Writ Petition is as to whether the Family Court was justified in relying upon Order VIII Rule 6A of the CPC to hold that the petitioner was not entitled to raise a counterclaim after having filed the written statement and upon expiry of period of limitation prescribed under Order VIII Rule 6A of the CPC ,ANALYSIS
b4a4cda04c5e4a0188e673ff63e0df43,5838,6081,The findings rendered by the Family Court can be upset only if it is found that the CPC would be applicable to the right of the petitioner to submit a counterclaim in the proceedings for divorce filed by the respondent before the Family Court ,ANALYSIS
25b703443a214c4c9af985397dad50b2,6082,6189,In this regard the following provisions of the Act of 1955 are relevant 21 Application of Act 5 of 1908 ,STA

e528161e60144d1b9fdd9b331b868067,6475,7215,In any proceedings for divorce or judicial separation or restitution of conjugal rights the respondent may not only oppose the relief sought on the ground of petitioner s adultery cruelty or desertion but also make a counterclaim for any relief under this Act on the ground and if the petitioner s adultery cruelty or desertion is proved the Court may give to the respondent any relief if he or she had presented a petition seeking such relief on that ground 10 A perusal of the above quoted Section 23A of the Act of 1955 that any proceedings for divorce initiated by a party the respondent would be entitled to raise a counterclaim and it would have to be treated as if the respondent had filed a petition seeking such relief ,STA
aeabe075261841158b9a0b4e9e75769e,7216,7370,There is no period of limitation or any other rider mentioned in the said Section 23A of the Act of 1955 as provided under Order VIII Rule 6A of the CPC ,ANALYSIS
1a43f1941e504c3ebd5c6e124a26abe7,7372,7550,Section 21 of the Act of 1955 quoted above shows that the CPC would be applicable to the proceedings initiated under the said Act subject to other provisions contained therein ,ANALYSIS
0298f93ef31348b1a90236614f839780,7551,7843,A conjoint reading of the aforesaid Section 21 and Section 23A of the Act of 1955 shows that the respondent in a proceeding initiated under the Act of 1955 would have a right to raise a counterclaim without being subjected to the specific fetters contained in Order VIII Rule 6A of the CPC ,ANALYSIS
2ddf87885a524055877091280c4164c3,7844,8000,This is because to the extent of applicability of Section 23A of the Act of 1955 the provisions of Order VIII Rule 6A of the CPC would not be applicable ,ANALYSIS
7fde1ac8be8f4ee28ab7c6084ce5b9d4,8001,8198,This clearly shows that the Family Court erred while passing the impugned order and holding that the application for raising counterclaim filed on behalf of the petitioner could not be entertained ,ANALYSIS
224445af857f4777a033eeefff1932a2,8198,8422, 11 In the judgment in the case of Sameeran Roy vs Smt Leena Roy supra relied upon by the learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner in a similar situation Madhya Pradesh High Court has held as follows 8 ,PRE_RELIED

cb0da5118339407392be59d17f6e8cd9,8545,8769,Subject to the other provisions contained in this Act and to such rules as the High Court may make in this behalf all proceedings under this Act shall be regulated as far as may be by the Code of Civil Procedure 1908 ,PRE_RELIED

b3a29f5e82f74043ba1a5a82e87bbf53,8924,9069,Thus this section clearly indicates that to an application under Section 13 of the Act the Code of Civil Procedure does not automatically apply ,ANALYSIS
6777149beb0a4a079d11f63c13d11d0a,9070,9247,The applicability of Code of Civil Procedure has been hedged by two conditions namely subject to other provisions of the Act and subject to the Rules framed by the High Court ,ANALYSIS

b4df017c636e44c3b2fdfb6b5a097111,9336,9488,Thus it is apparent that if any provision is in existence under the Act it would oust the application of the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure ,ANALYSIS
50acce3bc6324e98aab7219b9d264bd0,9489,9550,In this context Section 23A of the Act assumes significance ,ANALYSIS
cc42c3f713e34b76924b7f71b41a90c1,9551,9643,The provision reads as under 23A Relief for respondent in divorce and other proceedings ,STA
de7b8bef7e264b5b91b2455a54811d5a,9643,10110,In any proceedings for divorce or judicial separation or restitution of conjugal rights the respondent may not only oppose the relief sought on the ground of petitioner s adultery cruelty or desertion but also make a counterclaim for any relief under this Act on the ground and if the petitioner s adultery cruelty or desertion is proved the Court may give to the respondent any relief if he or she had presented a petition seeking such relief on that ground ,STA
78f8768a0b514153aa0dfe07e37b10ca,10110,10278,On a fair reading of the aforesaid provision it is graphically clear that a special provision of this nature provides for counterclaim in respect of a divorce petition ,ANALYSIS
d01f76373d474239b9ba9e0f27bdbdc2,10278,10546, Thus provision of Order 8 Rule 6A of the Code shall not be applicable in view of the provisions enshrined under Section 23A of the Act 12 This Court respectfully agrees with the reasonings given by the Madhya Pradesh High Court in the aforesaid judgment ,ANALYSIS
972dc093940a4fcfb1a9a3cdd4e96163,10546,11009, 13 Insofar as the question as to whether the petitioner could claim reliefs under the Act of 2005 before the Family Court by raising a counterclaim the learned Counsel appearing for the petitioner is justified in relying on Section 26 of the Act of 2005 wherein it is made clear that in a legal proceeding initiated before the Family Court any relief available under Sections 18 19 20 21 and 22 of the Act of 2005 can be claimed by an aggrieved person ,RATIO
ac53bfd13e294abd93a5240c1584ed61,11010,11290,Therefore there is no substance in the contention raised on behalf of the respondent that the petitioner could have claimed reliefs under the provisions of the Act of 2005 only before the Criminal Courts and not before the Family Court where divorce petition is already pending ,RATIO
a10f30facba74747bab229856fdb0193,11290,11353, 14 In view of the above the Writ Petition is allowed ,RPC

73f44c7d91334083a73ca9c898879cc0,1542,1804,For the relevant tax periods the assessee had sold some apartments for which it had disclosed the sale consideration out of which the cost of the land was disclosed in the returns at 45 and consequently paid tax on the sale consideration minus the land cost ,FAC
201e57d9c37f499696c8afee7c8c3bb2,1805,1918,The assessing authority did not accept the land cost at 45 but instead assessed it at 40 and assessed the tax ,FAC

296c1507fd3e43158cd18651658fe597,2426,2718,While passing the said order the first appellate authority relied on a decision of the Division Bench of this Court rendered in the case of Infinite Builders and Developers Bangalore vs The Additional Commissioner of Commercial Taxes Zone II Bangalore reported in 2013 76 Kar L J 390 ,FAC

fcfb3b7b8b934bf5a1da01464b50d677,3165,3728, 5 Although several questions of law are raised in these petitions learned counsel for the petitioner has today condensed the same and placed before us only two questions of law for determination by this Court which are as follows a Whether the appellate Tribunal is legally justified in holding that land cost at 50 that is not claimed in the returns cannot be considered in view of the decisions of this Court in the case of State of Karnataka vs Centum Industries Pvt Ltd and Infinite Builders Developers vs Additional CCT Zone II Bangalore ,ARG_PETITIONER
7aef0f4e1d584753a5f36fa09f9faf34,3728,4156, b Whether appellate Tribunal is legally justified in confirming the land cost allowed by the first appellate authority at 45 of the contract receipts even after noticing the finding of the first appellate authority that land cost as per registered sale deeds and the certificate of the Chartered Accountant worked out to 54 of the contract receipts merely for the reason that the same is not claimed in the returns filed ,ARG_PETITIONER
7175d7bd45b34cc0bbca497534f985f9,4158,4367,6 The main issue to be decided by this Court is as to whether the petitioner can be granted benefit over and above that what has been claimed in the returns filed by the assessee for the relevant tax periods ,ISSUE
1d673e14620a4a89b7428ca73dd49c6f,4368,4489,Admittedly the claim of the petitioner in its returns filed for the relevant tax periods was at 45 towards land cost ,FAC
64249da6639946ccbff5e7e22d8ff3c9,4490,4608,Though Assessing Officer allowed only 40 the first appellate authority granted the benefit of 45 towards land cost ,FAC
583bbede0dda4bb6bacc74864d623c31,4609,4883,The question now to be decided is whether unless a claim is made by the assessee in its return and without the same being revised or modified by filing a revised return any benefit beyond the benefit claimed in the return can be considered and allowed by the authorities ,ISSUE
53ecbc06d88449f5bcafbf508eb1e87b,4883,4931, 7 In our view the answer would be a clear no ,ANALYSIS
8a8fea3f1ba8401ab88ffaa77d8a5940,4931,5156, The Division Bench of this Court in the case of Infinite Builders and Developers Bangalore supra was considering a case where the first appellate authority had granted a benefit more than what was claimed by the assessee ,PRE_RELIED
c206a7e7142745079b15e105760fe522,5157,5229,The same was denied by this Court with the following observations 43 ,ANALYSIS
ea0af106a5f24973b3bac130a2a05e0e,5230,5425,The assessee never filed any revised return in respect of the period from April 2005 to March 2006 nor claimed any input credit return but on the other hand only filed nil tax liability return ,ANALYSIS
913f69292915488880f3d8f641f2b50c,5426,5538,The assessee persisted and did not file any revised return or anything at all even after inspection notice etc ,ANALYSIS
c94ca116daf54a8da737e47c2660ebac,5539,5736,In this view of the matter there was nothing at all before the Assessing Authority to provide any input tax deduction in favour of the assessee for the entire period from April 2005 to March 2006 ,ANALYSIS
ebb511ea452741d3bcc6f4cc32f100ce,5737,5949, So it is urged by the appellant assessee that even long after the expiry of the period in which the revised return could have been filed the fact remains that there is no response by filing any revised returns ,ANALYSIS
c4b131dd08784066b07d321d6873e167,5950,6343,In such a position we are of the view that the First Appellate Authority did go out of its duties and responsibilities and acted out of its jurisdiction to entertain a claim for deduction of input tax rebate in favour of the assessee by accepting some material purporting it to be based on the books of accounts and the purchase invoices etc and in granting reliefs to the assessee ,ANALYSIS
9f7e7b20b0de4e0db65ed6ab9cc2fdb4,6344,6648,We find it is a case of the First Appellate Authority acting more loyal than the king even though a claim had not been put forth by the assessee through the returns the First Appellate Authority has ventured to allow the appeals and grant relief to the assessee contrary to statutory provisions 8 ,ANALYSIS
d5712ce0d10b4ee9b2164f062e8ea7b0,6649,6838,Similar view has been taken by another Division Bench of this Court in the case of State of Karnataka vs Centum Industries Private Limited Bangalore reported in 2014 80 Kar L J 65 9 ,PRE_RELIED

97cceac5cbf24610a3a40f184e94eb9e,6913,7303,Learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the question in the aforesaid cases was regarding grant of input tax rebate as a deduction whereas in the present case according to the petitioner the claim is exclusion of land cost and as once the authority has accepted it to be higher than 50 no tax could be levied on such amount which was beyond 50 of the sale consideration ,RATIO
33b8969cf9ae42b48744ce5d5d53416f,7304,7699,We are unable to accept such submission made by the learned counsel for the petitioner as nothing more than what is claimed by the assessee in its return can be given by the authorities and if it is permitted then the assessing authority or the appellate authorities would be given unfettered powers to grant any such relief which may not even have been claimed by the assessee in its returns ,RATIO
ffae2ce2590045338d03455c86c26132,7700,7808,The Act provides for filing a revised return under Section 35 4 of the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act 2003 ,RATIO
c394794250004a32b7f6e69903e8d3e5,7809,8111,If the assessee fails to avail the benefit of filing revised return then it is only the return which is filed which has to be considered by the assessing officer or other authorities and nothing more than what is claimed in the return that can be granted by the authorities in favour of the assessee ,RATIO

1737885f12d545679dc67710f6ff95c4,29204,29470,But we must observe that relying on this circular the appellant deposited two months rent as required by the circular in addition to the two months rent as required by r 19 sub r 2 and that such deposits were duly made within 15 days from the date of the sale ,ANALYSIS

6202f924af814970996a4bcf2142059d,22521,22692,In his evidence P W 9 has not at all implicated accused Pramod Panigrahi and his wife Sumitra Mishra in subjecting the deceased to cruelty on account of demand of dowry ,ANALYSIS
7965fc11de2d4dfa8e4e41bce93f5652,22693,22735,He has virtually given them a clean chit ,ANALYSIS
fc7f8f0dd52c4364a74990e3d59cf8d1,22736,23092,He has only stated that his son in law accused Sanjeeb had sought for a financial help of Rs 50 000 which according to him would enable him to purchase a ten wheeler truck for the purpose of his business and when he refused he got miffed went away and about ten days after left his daughter at Budhapal chowk where from he had brought her to his home ,ANALYSIS
61149a571b0b4489af0555411b8b4ef8,23093,23242,His evidence to this effect which according to him had taken place prior to the filing of the divorce proceeding cannot be termed as demand of dowry ,ANALYSIS
51cacbb7ecc74999a6c33868594b3edc,23243,23421,The evidence of P W 10 is not at all indicative of the fact that accused Pramod Panigrahi and his wife Sumitra Mishra were subjecting the deceased to cruelty on account of dowry ,ANALYSIS
1ffd4cde5578452f85554973aabcb1ca,23422,23612,On the contrary it is his evidence that three months after the marriage of his sister deceased dissension had arisen between her and accused Sanjeeb relating to further demand of money ,ANALYSIS
06d37781e408405d9e224d17d0ba2f78,23613,23710,The evidence of P W 11 is of hearsay nature as has been admitted by him during cross examination ,ANALYSIS
aacd0b939a6745f8b04d726170e099ab,23711,23879,No other evidence is available in the record imputing the conduct of accused Pramod Panigrahi and his wife Sumitra Mishra in torturing the deceased during the marriage ,ANALYSIS
2a4c9ea2372c4719a9026f0b7de8c4a0,23880,24025,More over there is nothing in the record to show that soon before her death they were torturing her with a view to forcing her to bring dowry ,ANALYSIS
f75ad1cc5adc4350994db353bac9e654,24026,24472,In that view of the matter and in view of the settled law I am not persuaded to hold that in this case this court can import section 113 B of the Indian Evidence Act to hold that the accused Sumitra Mishra and Pramod Panigrahi who were the parents in law of the deceased subjected her to cruelty and harassment in connection with any demand for dowry soon before her death and are thus liable for punishment u s 304 B 34 of the I P C 15 ,ANALYSIS
4704dac298c04367ab827e99961348c3,24472,24691,In so far as the involvement of accused Sanjeeb Panigrahi for the offence u s 304 B of the I P C is concerned I find from Ext A that he had filed a divorce proceeding in C P 98 2010 against the deceased on 24 4 2014 ,ANALYSIS
6bdf702f6435451ba8ae04b12c2321a0,24692,24868,In his evidence before the Judge Family Court he has deposed as could been seen from Ext C that the deceased had left his house on 10 4 2010 leaving the child in his custody ,ANALYSIS
8dd793427fb8485e813d18282e78a60c,24869,25065,From Ext D I find that by swearing an affidavit the deceased had filed a Misc case where she has stated that she was residing at Juradanga in the District of Deogarh Odisha with her parents ,ANALYSIS
b63591f7791b44f2bc7f90ac31cf2f43,25066,25181,His seeking for financial assistance from his father in law as stated by P W 9 cannot be termed as demand of dowry ,ANALYSIS
fa996ec02a8341a899354106f85aaf46,25182,25365,So it cannot be held that soon before her death which was not under normal circumstance he was subjecting her to cruelty or harassment for or in connection with any demand of dowry ,ANALYSIS
49cfdf39f8044b6381addf86e85e6e2c,25366,25533,Hence he cannot also be held guilty u s 304 B of the I P C with the help of section 113 B of the Indian Evidence Act in view of the facts and circumstance of the case ,ANALYSIS
53687cee38ac4380b8e3d9e558aa2058,25533,25706, 16 The accused persons may not have committed the offence u s 304 B 34 of the I P C but had they abetted in any manner the commission of suicide of the deceased ,ANALYSIS
e19e02f57fdc4628bcb2445c6f86e9ad,25707,25733,Let us examine this point ,ANALYSIS
07443349a4a448dfb8149d71ce080fdd,25733,25797, 17 Section 107 of the I P C defines abetment of a thing ,STA
2aeed4d39dc64f1eb4cac2422dc32a5b,25798,26220,According to it A person abets the doing of a thing who First Instigates any person to do that thing or Secondly Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing or Thirdly Intentionally aids by any act or illegal omission the doing of that thing ,STA
3570043bd5e64c1f90f76657a803a050,26220,26364,It is established through the evidence that the deceased on 3 1 2012 had consumed insecticidal poison and her death was due to such consumption ,ANALYSIS
a20601c953a8438b9673b703a3c0b1f9,26365,26504,The date of her taking poison coincides with the date when her husband had deposed in C P 98 2010 before the Judge Family Court Rourkela ,ANALYSIS
98e03a500ffe4f00b4e35ff99a0032f4,26505,26611,There is no material in the record to prove that there is more to the said coincidence than meets the eye ,ANALYSIS
acdd9837042e4499a6907f920ca0fd58,26612,26760,Prosecution has failed to prove for the reasons indicated as above that she wa during the last days of her life staying with the accused persons ,ANALYSIS
a7c7849df0254ec09960e78a58367582,26761,26896,No cogent evidence is there in the record to suggest that due to torment on her by the accused persons she had decided to end her life ,ANALYSIS
e668c99e24ac45639eff73a5dd85caf0,26897,27134,It is therefore difficult to believe that the accused persons in furtherance of their common intention either instigated her or connived with each other or intentionally aided by any act or omission to prod her to take this extreme step ,ANALYSIS
d2ed7e9dd39645b394cc273120515c97,27135,27227,Hence a case u s 306 34 of the I P C appears not to be made out against the accused persons ,ANALYSIS
3791f52a1ac94439948f24c29fd5f5fd,27227,27508, 18 From the documents marked as Ext C from the side of defence it appears that the deceased had stayed with the accused persons in their house at R R I T Colony for some days and there after shifted to another residence to live with accused Sanjeeb Panigrahi until 10 4 2010 ,ANALYSIS
a6b0244956874ae99f70ba1c40bbbd2b,27509,27659,In the F I R it is alleged that the deceased was being subjected to cruelty by the accused persons on account of inadequate dowry during her marriage ,ANALYSIS
afcac5c6ded1469aadd32ca30a76a837,27660,27833,P W 9 and P W 10 have not whispered even a word about the involvement of the accused Pramod Panigrahi and Sumitra Mishra in causing such cruelty to her at any point of time ,ANALYSIS
3c266df1692346efad59c7b7ddaf1061,27834,27958,Both P Ws 9 and 10 have only alleged that at the time of marriage a sum of Rs 1 00 000 and some other articles were given ,ANALYSIS
a7251ee9036d4a48b6564e38bd9b1f37,27959,28151,Their statements to this effect are not sufficient to prove that accused Pramod and Sumitra had played any active or passive role in persecuting the deceased on account of inadequacy of dowry ,ANALYSIS
eb3e492d29eb4505abb68c65a97054ce,28152,28356,Of course both P Ws 9 and 10 as has been stated earlier have alleged that after the marriage dissension between accused Sanjeeb and the deceased arose and according to P W 1 it was on account of dowry ,ANALYSIS
6e4241fdf612483d8ceb5d45ace41d26,28357,28753,However the allegation against accused Sanjeeb to the effect that he asked P W 9 for financial help of Rs 50 000 and on refusal he got miffed is viewed with suspicion in as much as P W 13 who is the I O in this case has stated in her cross examination at para 15 and para 16 that these two witnesses have not made any such allegation before her during their examination u s 161 of the Cr P C ,ANALYSIS
0d28f3556e74460cafdf7e3829b76960,28754,29029,In that view of the matter I feel that prosecution has not been able to produce enough material to prove that the accused persons have in furtherance of their common intention committed the offence u s 498 A 34 of the I P C against the deceased during her stay with them ,ANALYSIS
47a66977a9624715890e439329d61b39,29029,29264, 19 In his evidence P W 9 has categorically alleged that accused Pramod Panigrahi had demanded a sum of Rs one lakh as dowry before the marriage of his son with the deceased and he had paid the same to him in two equal installments ,ANALYSIS
c5d02cd394934c04a62d1ed2135da84b,29264,29435, P W 10 has also stated to the effect that for the purpose of marriage of his sister with accused Sanjeeb his father had given dowry of Rs 1 00 000 and other articles ,ANALYSIS
7eb85a0e822446a49538017d5be84a99,29436,29523,The evidence of P W 10 to this effect has remained unassailed during cross examination ,ANALYSIS
8c602eb9f3774aa29efa54c12c29f9b4,29523,29747, Similarly the evidence of P W 9 that before the marriage the accused Pramod Panigrahi who is the father of accused Sanjeeb had demanded a sum of Rs 1 00 000 as dowry has not been repudiated during his cross examination ,ANALYSIS
4b48e9a664d141bc93b73614ca7ea9f1,29748,29912,On the other hand the FIR Ext 5 corroborates the fact that a sum of Rs 1 00 000 was given as dowry during the marriage of the deceased with the accused Sanjeeb ,ANALYSIS
d679760e30744df882ab2a12e0bcb9b3,29913,30006,Section 2 of the Dowry Prohibition Act defines dowry as under Sec 2 Definition of dowry ,STA
6ce48cb8bedf4e9cbdb6d091b18e7751,30007,30535,In this Act dowry means any property or valuable security given or agreed to be given either directly or indirectly a by one party to a marriage to the other party to the marriage or a by the parents of either party to a marriage or by any other person to either party to the marriage or to any other person at or before or any time after the marriage in connection with the marriage of the said parties but does not include dower or mahr in the case of persons to whom the Muslim Personal Law Shariat applies ,STA
7897303833de4af282f8e3b401deb5bc,30535,30613, Section 4 of D P Act reads as under Sec 4 Penalty for demanding dowry ,STA
93f07d86ce39431f9d339582e62fc3ed,30614,30947,If any person demands directly or indirectly from the parents or other relatives or guardian of a bride or bridegroom as the case may be any dowry he shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than six months but which may extend to two years and with fine which may extend to ten thousand rupees ,STA
35716b156b104503a1237b02d587689f,30955,31120,Provided that the court may for adequate and special reasons to be mentioned in the judgment impose a sentence of imprisonment for a term of less than six months ,STA
980125feaf5744c7bf7752a08fa7f678,31121,31511,20 The learned counsel for the accused persons submits that like a drowning man who catches at a straw prosecution is trying hard when no other ploy does appear to succeed to keep itself floating with the help of the evidence in this regard which should fail on account of the fact that there has been undue delay in bringing this matter to the fore and bringing the guilty to the book ,ANALYSIS
3b0a3b48c5b34819abb50d9f9b8aa328,31512,31637,Besides P W 13 I O has stated that P W 9 has not stated before him that he gave the said amount in two equal installments ,ANALYSIS
3311274443664e1d83b3954699aff730,31638,31736,The argument of the learned defence counsel in this regard does not appear to me to be convincing ,ANALYSIS
7659b61bc2eb4ec9bffdfe761f836bc9,31737,32014,It is but natural that parents with their anxiety to find a suitable groom for their nubile daughters meekly accede to such demands of the groom or his parents or his relatives knowing fully well that both the act of giving and taking of dowry is punishable in the eye of law ,ANALYSIS
90546635b7684e40aa119bb76f09851b,32015,32137,The parents of the bride in order to see that the marriage remains peaceful and blissful keep many things under the wraps ,ANALYSIS
d1b9e18f7fcf402a9ee3246594af346f,32138,32335,Viewed from that angle the reporting of the matter as regards the demand of dowry by accused Pramod Panigrahi at the time of his son s marriage with the deceased cannot be said to be over delayed ,ANALYSIS
bc090ab87675417aa958cd655d57cdc6,32336,32525,Here in this case the poor father had after his daughter s death shed the stoney silence and all inhibitions to speak his mind about the demand and acceptance of dowry by accused Pramod ,ANALYSIS
80a8fba89ac74e4caf632c2c0d9f7c18,32526,32767,His evidence which is supported by his son s as well as the contents of the FIR appears to me to be convincing in as much as though he had the occasion to impute the said allegation against accused Sanjeeb and his mother he had not done so ,ANALYSIS
b5bde5c6c7af41f6aae593e8e2e73b10,32768,32987,He has through his evidence proved that it was only accused Pramod who had demanded at the time of marriage a sum of Rs 1 00 000 and the contents of the FIR and the statement of P W 10 prove the fact that it was paid ,ANALYSIS
0f86ce3e87094be5aa013fbc6740454d,32988,33129,His not having stated before the I O that he paid the said amount in two equal installments is not a material omission and therefore ignored ,ANALYSIS
0d80b082d28842ef9264976074f5b4ba,33130,33373,I am therefore of the considered view that the said sum of Rs 1 00 000 which was given to accused Pramod Panigrahi by the father of the deceased was dowry and that by receiving the same he had committed the offence u s 4 of the D P Act 21 ,RATIO
fb2a92570e69479ca95bdacc7c600013,33374,33655, On mature reflection of the evidence on record which finds place in the discussion made as above I am of the considered view that prosecution has not been able to prove its case u s 302 304 B 306 498 A 34 of the I P C against all the accused persons beyond all reasonable doubt ,RATIO
3935b84f36d0468183ba810f5daaefce,33656,33748,Hence they are held not guilty there under and acquitted therefrom u s 235 1 of the Cr P C ,RATIO
88f85d4772f2404b8e7d1afe583b85fc,33749,33919,Similarly prosecution has also failed to establish a case u s 4 of the D P Act against accused Sumitra Mishra and accused Sanjeeb Panigrahi beyond all reasonable doubt ,RATIO

8598a166773b40bab772517336c59bce,2010,2257,This is an appeal against the judgment of the High Court at Calcutta upholding the order of the Ses sions Judge of Midnapore convicting the appellant under section 326 of the Indian Penal Code and sentencing him to 3 years rigorous imprisonment ,FAC
9e1b2458b2344326916aa8543a2dcab7,2257,2513, The prosecution case against the appellant may be short ly stated as follows The appellant and the injured person Kurnad Patra are first cousins and they live in a village called Andaria their houses being only 3 or 4 cubits apart from each other ,FAC
fe33d051c44742dfa8b7e71ba5593635,2514,2648,They had a dispute about a pathway adjoin ing their houses which led to a tank and they quarrelled about it on the 11th July 1949 ,FAC
9c88d7bb7a8d40f5a95596c2ce882ea7,2649,2820,Two days later on the lath July when Kumad Patra was washing his hands at the brink of the village tank the appellant came from behind and inflicted on him 17 injuries ,FAC
95b4951800d84d06919091e3c1c8115f,2821,2941,with the result that two of his fingers had to be amputated and a piece of bone had to be extracted from his left thumb ,FAC
0c8711e33e5249d49efafc6165b41a6e,2942,3136,The police being informed started investigation and submitted a charge sheet against the appellant who was finally committed to the Court of Sessions and tried by the Sessions Judge and a jury ,FAC
29c2454c03f4416cbdaa5907a43f5776,3137,3386,He was charged under section 307 of the Indian Penal Code but the jury returned a verdict of guilty against him under section 326 of the Penal Code and the learned Sessions Judge accepting the verdict convicted him under that section as aforesaid ,FAC
8390395f09d94979b1930ade075290b4,3387,3681,When the matter came up in appeal to the High Court a rule was issued on the appellant calling upon him to show cause why his sentenceshould not be enhanced but at the final hearing the rule was discharged his appeal was dismissed and his conviction and the original sentence were upheld ,FAC
3400caea5ac841488a932279fd304eab,3681,3996, The first point urged on behalf of the appellant before us is that inasmuch as there was no charge under section 326 of the Penal Code and the offence under that section was not a minor offence with reference to an offence under section 307 of the Code he could not have been convicted under the former section ,ANALYSIS
884918df0cf041329390e987db892666,3997,4090,This argument however overlooks the provisions of section 237 of the Criminal Procedure Code ,ANALYSIS
34849e87ca9241b39e57cc942f0c1997,4091,4642,That section after referring to section 236 which provides that alternative charges may be drawn up against an accused person where it is doubtful which of several of fences the facts which can be proved will constitute states as follows If the accused is charged with one offence and it appears in evidence that he committed a different offence for which he might have been charged under the provisions of that section he may be convicted of the offence which he is shown to have committed although he was not charged with it ,STA
ed0584a39e274691ab801fe20135e68b,4642,4813,There can be no doubt that on the facts of this case it was open to the Sessions Judge to charge the appellant alternatively under sections 307 and 326 of the Penal Code ,ANALYSIS
c3d3ca2517314628b497a8c844004347,4813,5006, The case therefore clearly falls under section 237 of the Criminal Procedure Code and the appellant s conviction under section 326 of the Penal Code was proper even in the absence of a charge ,ANALYSIS
454dd44f9787422fae82b4912e5d5076,5006,5233, In Begu v The King Emperor 1 the Privy Council had to deal with a case where certain persons were charged under section 302 of the Penal Code but were convicted under section 201 for causing the disappearance of evidence ,PRE_RELIED
70afaaccaae6404fa0393715c661c396,5233,5554, Their Lordships upheld the conviction and while referring to section 237 of the Criminal Procedure Code they ob served A man may be convicted of an offence although there has been no charge in respect of it if the evidence is such as to establish a charge that might have 1 1925 52 I A 191 been made ,PRE_RELIED
48b453a43a8d4327b61560cb2ed319e1,5555,5685,Their Lordships entertain no doubt that the procedure was a proper procedure and one warranted by the Code of Criminal Procedure ,PRE_RELIED
71d33a691fd44caa8db3ed20b2bf3f60,5687,5909,The second point urged on behalf of the appellant is that the High Court having issued a rule for the enhancement of the sentence he should have been allowed to argue the merits of the case which he was not allowed to do ,ANALYSIS
83d2aae7271a4122a391a95d6428b279,5910,6085,The learned counsel for the appellant was not however able to show that even if it was open to him to argue on the merits of the case the decision would have been otherwise ,ANALYSIS
219e6859f1284a058b5c1d0d46f84497,6086,6398,Only three contentions were put forward by him these being 1 that several material witnesses were not examined 2 that the appellant s case was not placed before the jury in a fair manner and 3 that there was no proper examination of the appel lant under section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code ,ANALYSIS
98bf98b89e014f1e9d91034806dae426,6398,6487, We have examined these contentions and find that they are entirely without merit ,ANALYSIS
5f917916fd104283b099a01798d1e934,6488,6760,In urging his first contention the learned counsel stated that though it was admitted that several persons have got houses to the east north and north west of the tank where the occurrence is alleged to have taken place they have not been examined by the prose cution ,ANALYSIS
2b440c956d614d53b46a4f4670a9185e,6761,6902,He further argued that one Sarat Chandra Ghose who was present at the house of the accused when it was searched has also not been examined ,ANALYSIS
a7007a5be4c1417c86497baa8cf898b9,6903,7206,These arguments however have very little force since there is no evidence to show that those persons had seen the occurrence an d they also do not take note of the fact that such evidence as has been adduced by the prosecution if believed was suffi cient to support the conviction of the appellant ,ANALYSIS
c10d2515eeda4a22ab5e26f4acaa74dd,7207,7431,The Ses sions Judge in his charge to the jury referred specifically to the very argument urged before us and he told the jurors that if they thought it fit it was open to them to draw an inference against the prosecution ,ANALYSIS
b3d169071ff4427bb5574918e79a1b62,7432,7610,There can be no doubt that the jurors were206 properly directed on the point and they evidently thought that the evidence before them was sufficient for convicting the appellant ,ANALYSIS
93ec98fa29f44e86b484d19193c79978,7610,7941, The second contention urged on behalf of the appellant relates to his defence which briefly stated was that Kumad Patra the injured man entered his house during his temporary absence went to the bedroom of his wife who was a young lady and committed indecent assault on her and was assaulted in these circumstances ,ANALYSIS
321500e43c1a4388aa4e5271fe2d1967,7942,8191,This story was not sup ported by any evidence but was merely suggested in cross examination and the Sessions Judge while referring to it in his charge to the jury observed If I were left alone I would not have believed the defence version ,ANALYSIS
93885a8c18414f748a730c305ebd9164,8192,8272,But you are not bound to accept my opin ion nor you should be influenced by it,ANALYSIS
edefc33ab229411b93469732af82e5e8,8273,8407,It is for you to decide whether you will accept the defence suggestion in favour of which there is no such positive evidence ,ANALYSIS
d1487e61140944e0b1da5e955ba78602,8407,8709,The Sessions Judge undoubtedly expressed himself some what strongly with regard to the defence suggestion but he coupled his observations which we think he was entitled to make with an adequate warning to the jurors that they were not bound to accept his opinion and should not be influenced by it ,ANALYSIS
013cae85455c4815802a27274e3ffea3,8710,8867,The defence version was rejected by the jury and there can be no doubt that on the materials on the record it would have been rejected by any court of fact ,ANALYSIS
0e4344383db44965b9dfe77df5cd11f2,8867,9039, The last contention put forward by the learned counsel for the appellant was that he was not examined as required by law under section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code ,ANALYSIS
4260db9127a84960a2588ba6e6bb356c,9040,9169,It appears that three questions ware put to the appellant by the Sessions Judge after the conclusion of the prosecution evidence ,ANALYSIS
cbb7fe05334e49028f15eff07dde51b7,9170,9538,In the first question the Sessions Judge asked the appellant what his defence was as to the evidence ad duced against him in the second question the Judge re ferred to the dispute about the pathway and asked the appel lant whether he had inflicted injuries on Kumad Patra and in the third question the appellant was asked whether he would adduce any evidence ,ANALYSIS
e3f98b7d5b274f98b5ef6f2405ea70a2,9539,9745,The facts of the case being free from any complications and the points in issue being simple we find it difficult to hold that the examina tion of the appellant in this particular case was not ade quate ,ANALYSIS
e9cd49bda8344a63ab65bea152f29d0a,9746,10020,To sustain such an argument as has been put forward it is not sufficient for the accused merely to show that he has not been fully examined as required by section 342 of the Criminal Procedure Code but he must also show that such examination has materially prejudiced him ,ANALYSIS
c6e99593177a4b54bb8e47a3fd027efc,10021,10236,In the present case it appears that the point urged here was not raised in the grounds of appeal to the High Court nor does it find a place in the grounds of appeal or in the statement of case filed in this court ,RATIO
d95189d2e0e6404d8f08ef2b199a3cde,10237,10399,It has nowhere been stated that the accused was in any way prejudiced and there are no materi als before us to hold that he was or might have been preju diced ,RATIO
d28e4f35bc034396b8752caf9f3b7f81,10400,10610,We have read the Sessions Judge s charge to the jury which is a very fair and full charge and nothing has been shown to us to justify the conclusion that the verdict of the jury should not have been accepted ,RATIO

5a31cedbe47740bd8acd60ae2a836dd2,1418,1723,The challenge in these writ petitions is to the order dated 28 03 2012 passed by the 1st respondent Joint Commissioner of Commercial Taxes VAT Division 1 Bangalore under Section 63 A of the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act 2003 for short the Act read with Section 9 2 of Central Sales Tax Act 1956 ,FAC
1921c217df924e6fa3b66e1bdf81a9b3,1723,1990, 4 The only ground on which the challenge made to the impugned order is sought to be sustained by the petitioner is with regard to the lack of territorial jurisdiction in the Joint Commissioner of Commercial Taxes VAT Division 1 Bangalore to deal with the matter ,FAC
8987ec20a56744b1bf6835504a2ace6b,1990,2430, 5 Learned counsel for the petitioner placing reliance on the order passed by the Commissioner for Commercial Taxes Bangalore on 19 09 2011 produced at Annexure E and the Annexures enclosed to it submits that the place where the petitioner carried on his business fell within the jurisdiction of Joint Commissioner for Commercial Taxes Administration Division 3 Bangalore and not within the jurisdiction of the 1st respondent herein ,ARG_PETITIONER
c75c5c28d0a241c6a20697fc22107443,2430,2873, 6 As is apparent from the order dated 19 09 2011 and the allocation of work made pursuant thereon which is clear from the chart appended to the order the present place of business of the petitioner falls within the territorial jurisdiction of the Joint Commissioner for Commercial Taxes Administration Division 3 Bangalroe and not within the territorial jurisdiction of the Joint Commissioner of Commercial Taxes Division 1 Bangalore ,ANALYSIS
e487a01ddfe54671ac5d1bfb6c30bd0e,2874,3313,However it is rightly contended by the learned High Court Government Pleader that the notice issued under Section 63 A of the Act to the petitioner on 04 07 2011 was addressed to the place of business of the petitioner at No 343 I Floor Narayana Pillai Street Commercial Street Bangalore 560001 and the same has been received by the petitioner at the same address on 06 07 2011 as is apparent from the endorsement made on the notice ,ANALYSIS
22143c3f16a4417b8762069d68039972,3314,3440,Copy of the same is part of the record that is produced for perusal of the Court by the learned High Court Government Pleader ,ANALYSIS
d1ca245962de418691e6779970f92aaf,3441,3870,It is thus clear that at the time when the notice was served on the petitioner without raising any objection with regard to the address the notice has been received at the same address and subsequently even when the reply to the notice was submitted on 12 12 2011 the petitioner has not raised any objection with regard to the territorial jurisdiction of the 1st respondent to exercise his power and jurisdiction in the matter ,ANALYSIS
c352d35d03504b1d8aabd198f0053f5e,3871,3947,It is in this background the 1st respondent has proceeded to pass the order ,ANALYSIS
116a6a27ac46495088b88ce95103cb95,3948,4123,For the first time the petitioner intends to raise the question on territorial jurisdiction by filing these writ petitions challenging the order passed by the 1st respondent ,ANALYSIS
b1ab3b9a59574e3bb080a3f944dbfc1b,4123,4452, 7 Section 67 of the Act states that no objection as to the territorial or pecuniary jurisdiction of any prescribed authority shall be entertained or allowed by any Court Tribunal or Authority in an appeal or revision unless such objection was taken before the prescribed authority at the earliest possible opportunity 8 ,STA
367191cd42014ad087d451cef2db8953,4453,4613,Therefore there is a clear bar enacted under Section 67 of the Act for the petitioner to raise objection to the territorial jurisdiction of the 1st respondent ,ANALYSIS
013bdbb229e64568820a15c670a50b15,4614,4855,Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the bar under Section 67 is for the Appellant or Revisional Court and not for this Court in writ jurisdiction and therefore the petitioner is entitled to raise this ground in the writ petition ,ARG_PETITIONER
1f545e98b51b441d9eba7672a6c328cc,4856,4891,This contention cannot be accepted ,ANALYSIS

3a053585b1134759ab5eea15252d01e5,3046,3307,Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case CESTAT failed to record a finding regarding the quantum of refund the assessee would be eligible in view of the specific dispute on the quantum and the consequential interest on such quantum of refund ,ISSUE
12159cf59b6749e9aa7b0590ded8290b,3309,3547,2 The present appeals arise in the following circumstances The respondent offered Information Technology Software Services as defined under the Finances Act 1994 to its foreign clients under the Service Agreement concluded with them ,FAC

60f09718d487438dbefa519a626bb961,3734,3964,Thereafter the respondent filed Ten claims with the Assistant Commissioner Division C Bengaluru for refund of Unutilized CENVAT Credit for the period between July 2012 to June 2015 under Rule 5 of the CENVAT Credit Rules 2004 ,FAC
7c3e8978fe524bb5b7b1a50547ba0a63,3965,4320,The Assistant Commissioner Division C Bengaluru examined the respondent s claim for refund and vide its separate orders dated 21 6 2017 allowed such claims for refund as provided for under Rule 5 of the CENVAT Credit Rules 2004 read with Notification No 27 2012 CE NT dated 18 6 2012 for short CENVAT Credit Rules Notification dated 18 6 2012 ,FAC

42ff8a2e46cf4e8b843693d4be25c09d,4426,4933, 3 The respondent being aggrieved by these orders insofar as refusal of interest for the delay in the refund filed Ten appeals before the Commissioner of Central Taxes Appeals 1 who dismissed these Ten Appeals in No 1091 1100 of 2017 holding that the respondent would not be entitled for payment of interest because the provision for payment of interest on delayed refund under Section 11BB of the Central Excise Act 1944 would apply only where there has been excess payment or collection of duty ,FAC
d77b5492c155494ab1798fe831718393,4934,5341,The Commissioner of Central Taxes Appeals 1 emphasized that the principle for payment of interest for the delay in refund contained in Section 11BB of the Central Excise Act 1944 cannot be extrapolated into Schema for refund of Unutilized CENVAT Credit as such Schema is nothing more than a facilitative mechanism provided to the exporter to convert the unutilized credit lying in its account into cash ,FAC
e03a77711afe4e24b75b28609e97f508,5342,5837,The fundamental difference between the Schema for the unutilized CENVAT Credit and refund of the excess duty paid or collected the Commissioner of Central Taxes emphasized is that in the former the unutilized credit lies in the assessee s account unlike in the case of excess payment of duty that would be with the State Exchequer as the State Exchequer would have the benefit of excess payment of duty the provision for payment of interest is provided under Section 11BB of the Customs Act ,FAC
4dbffde357f543508a7b63b0e152b83e,5839,6176,4 The respondent being aggrieved by this order preferred an appeal with the Appellate Tribunal and the Appellate Tribunal by its impugned final order dated 20 2 2018 set aside the common order in Appeals in Nos 1091 1100 of 2017 holding that the appellate order by the Commissioner of Central Taxes Appeals 1 cannot be sustained ,RLC

55eff623889b4cc0b2ad0cf23d8a2c94,6534,6779, 5 The learned counsel for the appellant revenue argued that payment of interest on delayed refund is payable under Section 11BB of the Central Excise Act 1944 for short the Act if the claim for refund is under Section 11B of the Act ,ARG_PETITIONER
b841ca5eab5f41b797ed6f8f439e92af,6780,6936,However the present claim by the respondent is for the refund of the unutilized CENVAT credit under the CENVAT Credit Rules Notification dated 18 6 2012 ,ARG_PETITIONER
44c3125de31047c79d1881637d7e2eef,6937,7085,As such the Department Revenue cannot be called upon to pay interest for delay in refund of the unutilized CENVAT credit under Section 11BB of Act ,ARG_PETITIONER
fee5d6fe23044e7b815fc5cb8dfd010f,7086,7219,The learned counsel elaborated that the claim for refund under Section 11B of the Act is in respect of excess duty paid or collected ,ARG_PETITIONER
994427d5627d4b83b0f302887b9ac54f,7220,7553,If the excess duty is paid or collected then upon receipt of an application as provided under Section 11B of the Act the interest on delay in refund is payable under Section 11BB of the Act provided that excess amount is not refunded within three months from the date of receipt of such application under Section 11B 1 of the Act ,ARG_PETITIONER
f06dd81ceda1484b8582cdb4c46feb51,7554,7864,Under Section 11 BB of the Act the interest on the excess duty paid or collected is payable from the date of receipt of application till the date of refund of such duty at such rate which is not below 5 and not exceeding 30 p a as is fixed by the Central Government by Notification in the Official Gazette ,ARG_PETITIONER
dcbae9abb2a2462987b576f686fb185c,7865,8119,However under Rule 5 of the CENVAT Credit Rules Notification dated 18 6 2012 a manufacturer or a provider of output service is allowed refund of such unutilized CENVAT credit subject to such safeguards conditions and limitations as may be specified ,ARG_PETITIONER
c2097796912a44a7babdaa4a219ec076,8120,8315,The unutilized CENVAT Credit lies in the account of the assessee and it is therefore distinct and separate from the excess duty paid or collected which would stand to the credit of the exchequer ,ARG_PETITIONER
19234380bc41489ebf64ed02363526df,8316,8476,As such no recourse should be had to the provisions of 11BB of the Act to award interest in the event there is any delay in refund of unutilized CENVAT credit ,ARG_PETITIONER
0005c040ebe64560abc048365c7ba7c8,8478,8845,6 The learned counsel for the appellant revenue argued that the Appellate Tribunal has not recorded any finding on the respondent s eligibility to interest under section 11BB of the Act if interest is payable the manner of computation of interest the period of commencement for computing interest and the quantum of refund on which interest is to be quantified ,ARG_PETITIONER
089f67c2008c4ccb9b5732b3903b97e7,8846,8909,As such the impugned order is perfunctory and contrary to law ,ARG_PETITIONER
4f8286152c284f9b8d8a6f28a0544c47,8909,9303, 7 The learned Counsel for the respondent on the other hand submitted that this question whether interest on delayed refund of unutilized CENVAT credit as contemplated under Rule 5 of the CENVAT Credit Rules Notification dated 18 6 2012 would be permissible under Section 11BB of the Central Excise Act has been considered by the High Court of Madras as well as the High Court of Gujarat ,ARG_RESPONDENT
ec304c98af57456995c275b3106bccf1,9304,9483,In fact the appellant revenue impugned the decision of the High Court of Gujarat before the Hon ble Supreme Court but the appellant revenue did not succeed in the said appeal ,ARG_RESPONDENT
f073b3db80e348aeb866523aa30a578f,9484,9553,Therefore the appellant revenue cannot re agitate the issue again ,ARG_RESPONDENT
1f2b44bd7ed7415b8d227612efdb6fb2,9553,10143, 8 The learned counsel further contended that the manner of computation of interest is also settled in view of the decision of the Hon ble Supreme Court in Ranbaxy Laboratories vs Union of India reported in 2011 273 ELT 3 SC wherein the Hon ble Supreme Court has declared that the liability of the Revenue to pay interest under Section 11BB of the Act commences from the date of expiry of three months from the date of receipt of application for refund under Section 11B i of the Act and not on the expiry of the three months period from the date on which the order of refund is made ,ARG_RESPONDENT
3ea952ff30734ec3b7323e1652ad2d15,10144,10274,There cannot be any quarrel over the quantum of refund in view of the orders of the Assistant Commissioner Division C Bengaluru ,ARG_RESPONDENT
ffe65eda34994091bfc8a9a15625b908,10275,10357,Therefore the impugned order does not suffer from any irregularity or perversity ,ARG_RESPONDENT
692ad66f6ecf4fcb97c4a36f4a7b3018,10357,10488, 9 The rival submissions are examined in the light of the decisions by the High Court of Gujarat as well as High Court of Madras ,ANALYSIS
5f998e51f77e442f9db856c419229400,10489,11255,The High Court of Gujarat in the case of Commissioner Central Excise vs Reliance Industries Limited supra while considering a similar canvas against the payment of interest on delayed refunds under Section 11BB of the Central Excise Act in terms of the obligation to refund under Rule 5 of the CENVET Credit Rules Notification dated 18 6 2012 did not accept the canvas on behalf of the revenue that the scheme for refund of unutilized CENVAT Credit is a special beneficial scheme with self contained procedure providing for the manner and method of its implementation and hence any refund claimed under the Rules would be governed only by the provisions of the Scheme and the general provisions of Section 11BB of the Central Excise Act cannot be resorted to ,PRE_RELIED
4892cebdd6a64366971a9282ab8ce38a,11256,11702,The High Court of Gujarat concluded that the CENVAT credit is nothing but duty paid by the supplier of inputs which are dutiable goods manufactured by the supplier or dutiable services rendered by the service provider when such goods services are utilized for further manufacture or providing service which are dutiable the manufactured goods or service provided carry the duty paid by the Supplier of inputs as a component of its price value ,PRE_RELIED
e19195b529b0422e865a908059cba573,11703,11846,Hence the duty payable on the ultimately manufactured goods services rendered stands reduced to the extent of duty already paid on the inputs ,PRE_RELIED
922c290fc73141e184e75b588aacafad,11847,11945,Thus the duty paid on inputs by the supplier has already been actually received by the exchequer ,PRE_RELIED
4514af58e41b4322b1805579dde281f1,11946,12146,Therefore there is a basic fallacy in the argument by the revenue that refund of unutilized CENVAT credit is different from excess duty paid or collected as contemplated under Section 11B of the Act ,ANALYSIS
ed1047495bd141b787dc82f1c122171a,12147,12395,As such the High Court of Gujarath held that when there is delay in sanctioning the refund under Rule 5 of the CENVAT Credit Rules Notification dated 18 6 2012 the provisions of Section 11BB of the Central Excise Act would be clearly attracted ,ANALYSIS
79a753a82c5f4ea8a3c2ce0e241e15e9,12395,12905, 10 The High Court of Madras which was considering allowing interest on the delayed refund of unutilized credit under the MODVAT Credit Scheme has also concluded that the MODVAT Credit taken was nothing but payment of duty which would be available to the assessee on the assessee paying duty on inputs at the time of clearance of final bills and therefore there is statutory obligation on the part of the appellant revenue under Section 11BB of the Act to pay interest for the delayed refund of the duty ,ANALYSIS
803f5b29dc884254bfa84708ebb8cfb2,12905,13256, 11 The learned counsel for the appellant revenue is unable to persuade this court to hold that the obligation to refund unutilized CEVANT Credit under Rule 5 of the CENVAT Credit Rules Notification dated 18 6 2012 is distinct and separate from the obligation under Section 11B of the Act in the light of the reasoning in the aforesaid decisions ,ANALYSIS
04a8c49bbaff4061ae00f36d918650af,13257,13593,This Court concurs with the reasons assigned in the aforesaid decisions to hold that the revenue would be obliged to pay under interest for the delayed refund as contemplated under Section 11BB of the Act even for the delayed refund of the Unutilized CENVAT credit under Rule 5 of the CENVAT Credit Rules Notification dated 18 6 2012 ,RATIO
0b122352a3624a459c0c3d6c28537862,13594,14059, There is also considerable force in the submissions on behalf of the respondent that in view of the decision of the Hon ble Supreme Court Ranbaxy Laboratories vs Union of India reported in 2011 273 ELT 3 SC that there cannot be any dispute about the liability of the Revenue to pay interest under Section 11BB of the Act commencing from the date of expiry of three months from the date of receipt of application for refund under Section 11B i of the Act ,RATIO

f2a9a995080a45e4a93dbc7ad21f9f2d,2602,2766,He was acquitted of the first two charges but was convicted of an offence under s 165 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year ,RLC
da27f1b3bfce4171b2f18dd08fec19b3,2766,2990, He appealed to the High Court of Madras but the High Court dismissed the appeal and affirmed the order of conviction but reduced the sentence to that of fine of Rs 400 in default rigorous imprisonment for three months ,RLC
9d2ed5ac21ad4126b737dcdf15f68203,2991,3136,The High Court has however granted a certificate under Article 134 1 c of the constitution that this was a fit case for appeal to this Court ,RLC
8b9fa8251814491282585ee6ec402db4,3137,3197,On the basis of that certificate this appeal has been filed ,FAC
00c358f331a94d8382416a30edb0ebc9,3197,3430, This prosecution case is that one K R Naidu who has been examined as prosecution witness No 8 a merchant having export business in onions chillies and groundnuts made on January 21 1958 an application for export of chillies ,FAC
f9067dcda9534be2ae2ae3778414e71b,3431,3519,He was informed by a letter dated March 5 1958 that the application had been rejected ,FAC
234c0d184b4a4184bf891c82293b68aa,3520,3651,This letter was purported to be signed by the Assistant Controllerof Exports for the Joint Chief Controller of Imports and Exports ,FAC
fa0f8741e5844a14b20e411ac7063665,3652,3819,Arumugam prosecution witness No 1 who bad been acting on behalf of Naidu in this matter then sought the assistance of this appellant for getting a permit for Naidu ,FAC
af7daa81cc284b9d9f85d54046788894,3819,4027, When he met the appellant later the same evening the appellant told him that an appeal would have to be preferred against the rejection order to the Joint Chief Controller of Imports and Exports Rangaswamy ,FAC
83a1ff6f6c4a41a3b230583de27bf086,4028,4170,The appellant also proposed that if he was given two bags of cement and Rs 50 he would use his influence and help him to get him the permit ,FAC
40022b67c77b4c6bb9eb9a62220ed9f7,4171,4291,Arumugam agreed and the appellant gave Arumugam a sheet of paper stating the address to which the cement was to be sent ,FAC
da3ea2fd9b214fa094d2a5ead2ddecac,4292,4403,On the next day the memorandum of appeal was sent by registered post to Rangaswamy the Joint Chief Controller ,FAC
e43d55b9e3364eb9b1c70515de7ac42d,4404,4548,The same day Arumugam saw the Deputy Superintendent Special Police Establishment and gave him a complaint in writing mentioning all the facts ,FAC
784f1391b01741b597c7bf27976635fe,4549,4652,A trap was thereafter laid with a view to catch the appellant in the actual act of accepting the bribe ,FAC
1ee0346be52b4ff985d3a04f68a758f9,4653,4914,On the evening of April 3 1958 Arumugam went to the house of the appellant with two cement bags which had been marked by putting attested cards inside the bags and Rs 50 in currency notes the number of which were noted by the Deputy Superintendent of Police ,FAC
694ec82a57dd4330b43ddaad2e49ff12,4915,4982,The appellant accepted the cement bags and the money from Arumugam ,FAC
bb595025e6eb41c799ef4089ea6d3a8d,4983,5068,The two cement bags were put in a room of the building as directed by the appellant ,FAC
13f89a0121ad4c6ab9322270a0623150,5069,5287,Immediately after this the Deputy Superintendent of Police who had been waiting according to the arrangement a little distance away from the house came into the cause on getting the pre arranged signal from Arumugam ,FAC
6cc35184ad3247c3b84dd5ea5b321320,5288,5381,He revealed his identity to the appellant and asked him to produce the money and cement bags ,FAC
e5cc5cee94ab4cdca921e9369f6d9a4d,5382,5583,The accused then took him upstairs and opened an Almirah with his own keys and produced from inside the Almirah the very notes of which the number had been taken by the Deputy Superintendent of Police ,FAC
51f4b8a7894a48b7af1b4ab2c93d37bd,5584,5650,The cement bags with the marks inside were also found down stairs ,FAC
9c3e39da9ab04e4facca43c710666fdc,5651,5682,The accused pleaded not guilty ,FAC
c7fd32e105334e5ea6e11c5bc1d48a0d,5683,6036,He admits the recovery of the cement bags and the currency notes from his house but pleads that neither of these have been given to him and that the notes were found on the table and the cement bags were in the hall nearby and these had been kept in his house without his knowledge or consent by Arumugam who wanted to make up a false case against him ,FAC
307a4c57629346b39154c7f82d97f2a9,6037,6183,According to him the whole story of his being approached by Arumugam or his asking for cement bags or money or accepting them is entirely false ,FAC
ee1ab175f51c4ba59458b0e3f4d80014,6184,6407,The Special Judge as also the High Court accepted the prosecution evidence in these matters as true and rejected the defence version and Mr Kumaramangalam has rightly not tried to challenge before us the findings of facts ,FAC
4dceac99e3df4b45b54676d9e62efeca,6408,6568,His principal contention in support of the appeal is that assuming the findings to be true an offence under s 165 Indian Penal Code had not been established ,FAC
df2a5f9aa0f544d0b891e9aa1514575d,6569,6728,This contention is based mainly on the fact that the appellant was Assistant Controller of Imports only and had no connection with the issue of export permits ,ANALYSIS
11f42aa15f4249c6a0351e88278d6006,6729,7028,According to the learned Counsel he was not therefore subordinate to the Joint Chief Cont roller of Imports and Exports to whom the appeal petition had been filed and consequently his acceptance of cement bags from Arumugam did not amount to an offence under section 165 of the Indian Penal Code ,ANALYSIS
24bc9da602674ca6bcbab2c534c5c5cb,7029,7083,Section 165 of the Indian Penal Code runs thus 165 ,STA
f1a310efe99e4232b7e6703fafce1321,7084,7849,Whoever being a public servant accepts or obtains or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain for himself or for any other person any valuable thing without consideration or for a consideration which knows to be inadequate from any person whom he knows to have been or to be or to be likely to be concerned in any proceeding or business transacted or about to be transacted by such public servant or having arty connection with the official functions of himself or of any public servant to whom he is subordinate or from any person whom he knows to be interested in or related to the person so concerned shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years or with fine or with both ,STA
978fdf0e0a7e4e71b405d0456aa2d037,7850,7997,What has been proved in this case is 1 that the appellant a public servant accepted some valuable things from Arumugam without consideration ,ANALYSIS
59e3ac0a7157456abbcd91a400ca4a6d,7998,8099, 2 Arumugam was concerned in an appeal against an order rejecting an application for export licence ,ANALYSIS
7143fd336b9242fb8ae875b58a2478fb,8100,8241, 3 this proceeding bad connection with the official functions of the Joint Chief Controller of Imports and Exports who was a public servant ,ANALYSIS
55b8927a89f145aba2cdad6712676c56,8241,8410, 4 The appellant knew that Arumugam was concerned in this proceeding having connection with the official function of the Joint Chief Controller of Imports and Exports ,ANALYSIS
fd044aaf49e545b7ba2a5e084bce4839,8411,8534, 5 The appellant was in respect of his official position subordinate to the Joint Chief Controller of Imports and Exports ,ANALYSIS
34685b77331144209777ef1e30be663c,8535,8724,It may be mentioned that it is not disputed that at the relevant time viz March 1958 the accused was the Assistant Controller of Imports only and had nothing to do with export permits ,ANALYSIS
eb0b8d73258a4251b134895cef5cdfbe,8724,8841, All the ingredients of an offence under s 165 Indian Penal Code appear therefore to have been proved prima facie ,ANALYSIS
5b27fac3b8d144eebf598704504ef1cc,8842,9178,Mr Kumaramangalam s contention is that the fifth fact mentioned above viz that the appellant was in respect of his official position subordinate to the Joint Chief Controller of Imports and Export is not sufficient to establish his subordination to the Joint Chief Controller of Imports and Exports within the meaning of s 165 ,ANALYSIS
f10a7e5385084d45b840e753f730135f,9178,9301, Subordination of public servants to other public servants is a well known and inevitable feature of public administration ,ANALYSIS
659c1051e43a4c26ac64072da03d53d1,9302,9436,And when a question arises in any case whether a public servant A is a subordinate to public servant B it presents little difficulty ,ANALYSIS
22cd939aa95545d28572505e56d76e7b,9437,10014,Thus in that branch of the State s public administration which deals with regulation of Imports into and exports from India one would state without difficulty that an Assistant Controller of Imports is subordinate to the Joint Chief Controller of Imports and Exports so also the Assistant Controller of Exports is subordinate to the Joint Chief Controller of Imports and Exports but the Assistant Controller of Exports is not subordinate to the Assistant Controller of Imports nor is the Assistant Controller of Import subordinate to the Assistant Controller of Exports ,ANALYSIS
065b6e7d45944a9a8578bc04da341634,10015,10134,According to the learned Counsel in s 165 the word subordinate should be interpreted as functionally subordinate ,ANALYSIS
1f1a26ae94024a47a1d090575d1ba3fd,10135,10544,He contends that while the appellant was administratively subordinate to the Joint Chief Controller of Imports and Exports he was not functionally subordinate to that officer as Assistant Controller of Imports he had nothing to do with the matter of appeal against the rejection of the application for exports so he was not subordinate to the Joint Chief Controller within the meaning of the section ,ANALYSIS
50aaa540995645d9a87d27b1d2c50bfa,10544,10742, The use of the words functionally subordinate does not appear to be very happy as in every case of administrative subordination there is also subordination in respect of some functions at least ,ANALYSIS
d595ba144e524ddc8cbb3fa05d61165a,10743,10951,What the learned Counsel really meansby his argument is that subordinate in the section means subordinate in respect of those very official functions with which the business or transaction has connection ,ANALYSIS
bbae7c4905bc4255aa8f0f114ccc3a1f,10952,11635,In support of his arguments he has drawn our attention to the provisions of a 161 s 162 and s 163 of the Indian Penal Code and he points out that s 161 makes punishable the taking by a public servant of gratification in respect of his officials act or his official functions s 162 makes punishable the taking of gratification by any person for inducing by corrupt or illegal means a public servant to do or not to do some thing in connection with his official functions s 163 makes punishable the taking of gratification by any person for inducing by the exercise of personal influence a public servant to do or not to do something in connection with his officials function ,ANALYSIS
cc9f6ffe77ee4a41bf7377188e42e363,11635,11731, Section 164 it may be mentioned makes punishable the abetment of offences under s 162 and 163 ,STA
2519b8b79bb2480d8d3b2541f9e45d9d,11732,12049,In this context the learned Counsel argues the words in s 165 should be so interpreted as to make punishable only such taking of gratification by a public servant as has in some way connection with his own official functions and so he argues subordinate in the section should be interpreted as suggested by him ,ANALYSIS
1dc888867cd6433ea206f690fc4aca5f,12050,12202,To a emphasise his point he gave this illustration X the Collector of a District is dealing with a matter of assessment of revenue on A s application ,ANALYSIS
9acb8ae6341b4ea0a6773186f15501b4,12203,12510,Y a office Peon of a department under the Collector which has nothing to do with revenue matters accepts money from A knowing that A has such business with X Y will then be committing an offence under is 165 even though Y has no connection whatsoever with the functions of X in respect of A s application ,ANALYSIS
22f17e5a385f4fd085f253a7ff142e37,12510,12702, It will perhaps not often happen that Y will have an opportunity of accepting money from A when he has not even a plausible chance of doing something for A in connection with the application ,ANALYSIS
c9a0dade642148539cc94907e5d2146d,12703,12908,But assuming that he has that opportunity and does accept the money as stated in the illustration above we cannot see what untoward consequences will ensue if Y s conduct is made punishable under s 165 ,ANALYSIS
2fd353c7ce6c4579a9b6984ddf1746c5,12909,13045,It has to be noticed that s 165 has been so worded as to cover cases of corruption which do not come within s 161 or a 162 or s 163 ,ANALYSIS
8fac7b7f853a406ea3e9b429b1c46169,13046,13302,When with that intention the legislature has used the word subordinate in s 165 without any limitation there is no justification for reading into the word the limitation suggested by the learned Counsel by the words in respect of those very functions ,ANALYSIS
656e47c412c54b44819ebd82878bc1fc,13303,13456,It is plain that the interpretation suggested by Mr Kumaramangalam needs the addition of some words in the section and that is clearly not permissible ,ANALYSIS
17f2a85db2ca46d295f7413ad3df1b3a,13457,13717,By the use of the word subordinate without any qualifying words the legislature has expressed its legislative intention of making punishable such subordinates also who have no connection with the function with which the business or transaction is concerned ,ANALYSIS
7456a6d7bfd84ffa8dce100ca2d59537,13718,13900,To limit the meaning of subordinate in the section as suggested by the learned Counsel would be defeating that legislative intention and laying down a different legislative policy ,ANALYSIS
e048599a5c88438c89baefb3c97e3e76,13901,13935,This the Court has no power to do ,ANALYSIS
1b5928e419e34a479934e0c3612b6b87,13936,14052,The argument that subordinate means something more than administratively subordinate must therefore be rejected ,ANALYSIS
25dd999bae1b4a4ab648ece094956ab2,14053,14293,The appellant has therefore rightly been held to be Subordinate to the Joint Chief Controller even though the appellant had no functions to discharge in connection with the appeal before the Joint Chief Controller of Imports and Exports ,ANALYSIS
c445e37baa7d47b08aeffc754d5f8bf0,14293,14529, Mr Kumaramangalam then wanted to argue that the facts and circumstances of the case showed that Arumugam was a police informer and that he was really not concerned in the appeal before theJoint Chief Controller of Imports and Exports ,ANALYSIS
b0bffbd6ff76449b8ad3ad7bdc346aa2,14530,14649,Therefore he points out it would be reasonable to hold that no offence under s 165 had been committed by his client ,ANALYSIS
2a048a3110504d469c166cf5420c7556,14650,14968,We find however that the High Court granted the certificate only on the ground that the question raised by the Counsel as regards the interpretation of the word subordinate in the section was a substantial question of law which was not covered by any specific authority and was also a question of public importance ,ANALYSIS
a0fa2c6858464de0a2f8828f739a98fc,14969,15150,In view of this we do not think it right to investigate the further question sought to be raised by Mr Kumaramangalam in this case and we have not allowed him to argue that matter ,RATIO
e647298fc99e40bbacd35c5d52d6740d,15150,15308, We think it proper to add that we have not been able to appreciate why the High Court thought it necessary to reduce the sentence imposed by the Trial Court ,RATIO

3b7d8d30bf8f4a98a4fd9d9c2fbd4891,20147,20851,When the prosecution comes with a definite case that the offence has been committed by the accused and proves its case beyond any reasonable doubt it becomes hardly necessary for the prosecution to again explain how and in what circumstances injuries have been inflicted on the person of the accused But in the case of State of Rajasthan v Madho AIR 1991 SC 1065 it was held If the prosecution witnesses shy away from the reality and do not explain the injuries caused to the respondents herein it casts a doubt on the genesis of the prosecution case since the evidence shows that these injuries were sustained in the course of the same incident ,PRE_RELIED
0bb24feca1374899ab1068cfd1602ce1,20852,20937,It gives the impression that the witnesses are suppressing some part of the incident ,PRE_RELIED
3281c206b28a42c795b59aba0b073a20,20938,21192,The High Court was therefore of the opinion that having regard to the fact that they have failed to explain the injuries sustained by the two respondents in the course of the same transaction the respondents were entitled to the benefit of the doubt ,PRE_RELIED
79cea3028d204f28bf7b47bddace0d0a,21192,21329, As first impression there appears to be some conflict in the views expressed in the different judgments of this Court referred to above ,ANALYSIS
8a87143b4ffb488aae01ac6bb7dda932,21330,21600,But on proper reading with reference to the facts of each case there is no basic difference and according to us this Court rightly in the case of The State of Gujarat v Bai Fatima supra put in three categories the result which may follow from the facts of each case ,ANALYSIS
65120afbcb984e049c4a78cf42c817fe,21601,21726,It is well known that guilt of theaccused is to be judged on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the particular case ,ANALYSIS
27e2c02000fb4bbba7c527184620213e,21727,21922,In any particular case the injuries found on the person of the accused being serious in nature may assume importance in respect of the genesis and manner of occurrence alleged by the prosecution ,ANALYSIS
944e29d89ecb4ab8b5ce5f12cbcc0c82,21922,22303, In other case the injuries being superficial by themselves may not affect the prosecution case the version disclosed by the prosecution having been proved by witnesses who are independent reliable and trustworthy supported by the circumstances of that particular case including the prompt ness with which the first information report was lodged on behalf of the prosecution ,ANALYSIS
1e3fa217752e49bdba6bd2721160d3ee,22304,22859,But if the first information report has not been lodged promptly and there is no reasonable explanation for the delay the witnesses who support the version of the prosecution are not only inimical but even their evidence is not consistent with the circumstances found during the course of investigation then in that situation injuries on the person of the accused which are not very serious in nature assume importance for the purpose of consideration as to whether the defence of the right of private defence pleaded by the accused should be accepted ,ANALYSIS
73d15df47e404882a063bf286c22fa3e,22859,22970, It is well known that accused pleading the right of private defence need not prove it beyond reasonable doubt ,ANALYSIS
7605011e383e40d98e6a592f70f2023c,22971,23126,It is enough if on the basis of the circumstances of a particular case applying the test of preponderance or probabilities the version becomes acceptable ,ANALYSIS
8039430e0f434f26be5eb40ccc1e9b2b,23127,23358,There are not two parallel versions before the Court one on behalf of the prosecution and other on behalf of the accused and the Court is required to choose as to which of the two versions is the correct version of the occurrence ,ANALYSIS

76006ae33913419ca04123c5549a4819,25121,25206, Then why first information report was lodged at 11 30 P M there is no explanation ,ANALYSIS
ae046e8a1afb4f08ae50274448e20976,25207,25347,On the other hand the appellant s case is that the occurrence did not take place at 6 00 P M in the evening but at later part in the night ,ANALYSIS

ccf8bef8d8c1447cb68f85e5e4bd5c40,1195,1555,The learned Magistrate after considering the avernments in the complaint came to the conclusion that it was not proper to direct investigation into the matter as contemplated under Section 156 3 of the Code but it would be sufficient if the complaint is proceeded further by examining the complainant on oath as contemplated under Section 200 of the Code ,FAC
22bb0cf3850544378d7004d62099122e,1555,1706, The petitioner was not happy with this view of the Magistrate and challenged the Magistrate s order by approaching the Court of Sessions in Revision ,FAC
b80d430e87aa4635954dca95a24b0f69,1707,2310,The Additional Sessions Judge Aurangabad who heard the Revision found the order passed by the Magistrate to be proper and dismissed the Revision Being aggrieved thereby the petitioner has approached this Court invoking its constitutional jurisdiction and praying that the orders passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate and by the Additional Sessions Judge be set aside and that a direction may be given to the Police to register a crime and commence the investigation 3 I have heard Mr P N Kalani the learned counsel for the petitioner and Mr K S Patil the learned A P P for Respondent ,RLC

9eb763baa5d04e4f8f06a557eec8cf87,3582,3864,Particularly there is substance in the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the Chief Judicial Magistrate s interpretation of the observations made in the case of Popatbhai Panchambhai Bhutani V s State of Maharashtra 2010 All M R Cri 244 is not correct ,PRE_NOT_RELIED
d216a93555874f7785435fd861336ea5,3865,4182,It appears that the Chief Judicial Magistrate was of the view that an order for investigation as contemplated in Section 156 3 of the Code should not be passed unless the aggrieved person has approached a superior officer of the police against the refusal by the Incharge of the Police Station to register a crime ,ANALYSIS

4998cefc9e61437c8ebe7e23830efd9e,4486,4849,In case of refusal to register a crime on the basis of such report by the Officer Incharge of a Police Station the superior officer of the police may or may not be approached by the informant and approaching such a superior officer cannot be said to be a condition precedent for approaching the Magistrate for seeking an order under Section 156 3 of the Code ,ANALYSIS
0d8345033269453780c797961f2ad029,4850,5191,As a matter of fact the decision clearly lays down that there is no legal bar for approaching a Magistrate directly i e even without invoking provisions of Section 154 of the Code but it has been laid down that normally a person should invoke the provisions of Section 154 of the Code before taking recourse to the powers of a Magistrate ,ANALYSIS
3b82674ae7e94b0c81c537e02e345dfc,5192,5583,Thus ordinarily a report should be made to the officer Incharge of the police station before approaching a Magistrate but this requirement cannot be further stretched to mean that in case of refusal by an officer incharge of a police station a superior officer of the police must necessarily be approached before a Magistrate is approached for an order under Section 156 3 of the Code ,ANALYSIS

0f82ceb4dff74291a5684081e88fc470,1416,1698,On reference of this dispute the Industrial Tribunal held that the assault could be treated as a private matter between R and A with which the appellant was not concerned and as a result Standing Order 22 viii could not be invoked against R and it ordered the reinstatement of R ,PREAMBLE
2797407882e642ceaf04f99e9d02770b,1699,1980,On appeal by special leave Held i that It would be unreasonable to include within Standing Order 22 viii any riotous behaviour without the factory which was the result of purely private and individual dispute and in course of which tempers of both the contestants become hot ,PREAMBLE
84668771b4c849b08a9a7bf97cc97918,1981,2491,In order that standing order 22 viii may be attracted the appellant should be able to show that the disorderly or riotous behaviour had some rational connection with the employment of the assailant and the victim ii In the present case the assault by R on A was not a purely private or individual matter but was referable to the difference of opinion between the two in regard to the introduction of incentive bonus scheme and that cannot be said to be outside the purview of standing order 22 viii ,PREAMBLE
201a99c54ae94e1799e619958d1cf228,2491,2674, iii The Tribunal was in error in coming to the conclusion that the enquiry suffered from the infirmity that it was conducted contrary to the principles of natural justice ,PREAMBLE
fd21caf3ebd5473283c49c4af26625cc,2674,3172, It is true that if it appears that by refusing to adjourn the hearing at the instance of charge sheeted workmen the Enquiry Officer failed to give the said workmen a reasonable opportunity to lead evidence that may in a proper case be considered to introduce an element of infirmity in the enquiry but in the circumstances of this case it would not be possible to draw such an inference iv The finding of the Tribunal that the dismissal was malafic cannot possibly be sustained ,PREAMBLE
5d9d6cd69d0d44099b9e0a00f6145f9a,3172,3426, The Tribunal has completely overlooked an elementary principle of judicial approach that even if a judge or Tribunal may reach an erroneous conclusion either of fact or of law the mere error of the conclusion does not make the conclusion malafide ,PREAMBLE
ec977ba75c1c4a9686fa186d34a545b5,3428,3659, v Since the domestic enquiry had been fairly conducted and the findings recorded therein were based on Evidence which was believed there was no justification for the Industrial Tribunal to consider the same facts for itself ,PREAMBLE
7500efb8b4934f568f6a95f153496046,3659,4342, Findings properly recorded at such enquiries are binding on parties unless of course it is shown that such findings are perverse or are not based on any evidence Phulbari Tea Estate v Its Workmen 1960 1 S C R 32 referred to vi The Industrial Tribunal was in error when it charac terised the result of the domestic enquiry as malafide partly because the enquiry was not stayed pending criminal proceedings against R It is desirable that if the incident giving rise to a charge framed against a workman in a domestic enquiry is being tried in a criminal court the employer should stay the domestic enquiry pending the final disposal of the criminal case ,PREAMBLE
72f849f28ad5469e9497c69832ca6b54,4343,4564,It would be particularly appropriate to adopt such a course when the charge is of a grave character because it would be unfair to compel the workman to disclose the defence which he may take before the criminal court ,PREAMBLE
846e50c870714eb1bf3c15911648a728,4565,5008,But to say that domestic enquiries may be stayed pending criminal trial is very different from saying that if an employer proceeds with the domestic enquiry inspite of the fact that the criminal trial is pending the enquiry for that reason alone is vitiated and the conclusion arrived at in such an enquiry is either bad in law or malafide Delhi Cloth General Mills Ltd v Kishan Bhan 1960 3 S C R 227 referred to JUDGMENT ,PREAMBLE

80e2d9a256234cbda4bc0ec88e405983,5453,5744,This appeal by special leave raises a short question about the validity of the order passed by the Industrial Tribunal Ernakulam directing the appellant the Tata Oil Mills Co Ltd to reinstate its workman K K Raghavan whom it had dismissed with effect from the 14th of November 1955 ,FAC
6bd644c5246e4d91b4e860207cc65004,5745,5840,The appellant is a public limited concern engaged in the industry of soaps and toilet articles ,FAC
72b06864673444479132dca302875ac6,5841,5897,It owns three factories in addition to 12 sales offices ,FAC
956908371cd84862b5149e75fd0e5b05,5898,5980,One of these factories is located at Tatapuram Ernakulam in the State of Kerala ,FAC
81ca1136bef042f1804ffd2e168c4e79,5981,6053,Mr Raghavan was working with the appellant at its factory at Tatapuram ,FAC
d3a58d1222994937875bba1921c7244c,6054,6373,It was reported to the appellant that on the 12th November 1955 Mr Raghavan and another employee of the appellant Mr Mathews by name waylaid Mr C A Augustine the Chargeman of the Soap Plant of the company s factory at Tatapuram while he was returning home after his duty in the second shift and assaulted him ,FAC
6b686eabe2fc41768cf0a1f31a31e06f,6374,6480,That is why charge sheets were issued against both Messrs Raghavan and Mathews on the 14th November 1955 ,FAC
8a63dc77789646b082aa02dc98a33928,6481,6768,Pursuant to the service of the charge sheets two officers were appointed by the appellant to hold an enquiry but the respondent Union represented to the appellant that justice would not be done to Raghavan and Mathews unless somebody outside Tatapuram was invited to hold the enquiry ,FAC
6063959fde6d47d8bc2df5db8e5d5a5a,6769,6922,Thereupon the General Manager of the appellant appointed Mr Y D Joshi who is a Law Officer of the appellant in the Head Office to hold the enquiry ,FAC
91f33e4be25b4dbc8ffecb5087bd0f86,6923,7090,Mr Joshi held the enquiry from the 27th to 30th December 1955 and subsequently he made his report to the General Manager of the appellant on the 7th January 1956 ,FAC
8b06ad9927cf4ce581958b606bf8ed5b,7091,7298,At that time an industrial dispute was pending between the appellant and its employees and so the appellant applied to the Industrial Tribunal for approval of the dismissal of Messrs Raghavan and Mathews ,FAC
f05af675e4c34d2c9951c15ffa1b81fb,7299,7411,The Tribunal approved of the dismissal of Raghavan but did not accord its approval of the dismissal of Mathews ,RLC
94579cc6944a4d559236b2bb44d5b2c7,7412,7548,Acting in pursuance of the approval accorded by the Tribunal the appellant dismissed Raghavan with effect from the 14th November 1955 ,RLC
90966b611a5843fe9ebafcce60d0a15a,7549,7821,Not satisfied with the order of dismissal the respondent raised an industrial dispute in regard to the propriety and validity of the said dismissal of Raghavan and that has become the subject matter of the present reference which was ordered on the 3rd of December 1958 ,FAC
86533ba0360349ada67993092482d732,7822,7983,It is on this reference that the Industrial tribunal has held that the appellant was not justified in dismissing Raghavan and so has ordered his reinstatement ,FAC
b142a77447254a04bafa4b71001db62a,7984,8062,This is the order which has given rise to the present appeal by special leave ,FAC
a1eae6a50fcc41c9b165ee2235a8e91c,8062,8315, The first point which calls for our decision in this appeal is whether the Tribunal was right in holding that the facts proved against Raghavan did not attract the provisions of Standing Order 22 viii of the Certified Standing Orders of the appellant ,ISSUE
f03243fb86ce4524a99a4156f5e51c78,8316,8570,The said standing order provides that without prejudice to the general meaning of the term misconduct it shall be deemed to mean and include inter alia drunkenness fighting riotous or disorderly or indecent behaviour within or without the factory ,ANALYSIS
cdd3fe178f1543dca0362f6c326f4a3b,8571,8697,It is common ground that the alleged assault took place outside the factory and in fact at a considerable distance from it ,ANALYSIS
3031287717ec4880b2ac983fe5c39dc4,8698,8949,The Tribunal has held that the assault in question can be treated as a purely private matter between Raghavan and Augustine with which the appellant was not concerned and as a result of which standing order 22 viii cannot be invoked against Raghavan ,ANALYSIS
06c5798422d54007b20f924fb371c111,8950,9190,Mr Menon who has appeared for the respondent before us has contended that in construing standing orders of this charac ter we must take care to see that disputes of a purely private or individual type are not brought within their scope ,ARG_RESPONDENT
6cc3108364c24e98bb2886d4780330f2,9191,9365,He argues that on many occasions individual employees may have to deal with private disputes and sometimes as a result of these private disputes assault may be committed ,ARG_RESPONDENT
c4e25927716a435a81c462d2e2641a81,9366,9495,Such an assault may attract the relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code but it does not fall under standing order 22 viii ,ARG_RESPONDENT
df8e6c7a41314f9e81ce3818906e9195,9496,9544,In our opinion this contention is well founded ,ANALYSIS
7affc5c31e70425cab804207881348a8,9545,9793,It would we think be unreasonable to include within standing order 22 viii any riotous behaviour without the factory which was the result of purely private and individual dispute and in course of which tempers of both the contestants became hot ,ANALYSIS
2b6318d68a9a44ba9a8449527f1b429d,9794,10009,In order that standing order 22 viii may be attracted the appellant should be able to show that the disorderly or riotous behaviour had some rational connection with the employment of the assailant and the victim ,ANALYSIS
47abdca2f3dc4ce190a725d17561913e,10009,10156, In the present case however it is quite clear that the assault committed by Raghavan on Augustine was not a purely private or individual matter ,ANALYSIS
3331546fe5b64aac89ac708d9050d08f,10157,10454,What the occasion for this assault was and what motive actuated it have been consider ed by the domestic Tribunal and the findings of the domestic Tribunal on these points must be accepted in the present proceedings unless they are shown to be based on no evi dence or are otherwise perverse ,ANALYSIS
fecf32f8772141889f7bc88b986fc151,10455,10740,Now when we look at the report of the Enquiry Officer it is clear that on the evidence given by Mr M M Augustine and K T Joseph it appeared that the assault was committed by Raghavan on C A Augustine because he was in favour of the introduction of the Incentive Bonus Scheme ,ANALYSIS
ec253f5e944846288a4b9009a6ee5be4,10741,11001,It appears that the introduction of this incentive bonus scheme was approved by one set of workmen and was opposed by another with the result that the two rival unions belonging to these two sets respectively were arrayed against each other on that question ,ANALYSIS
59241252a23841aabf42c62363b438e6,11002,11467,The evidence of the two witnesses to whom we have just referred clearly shows that when Raghavan assaulted C A Augustine he expressly stated that Augustine was a black leg Karinkali who was interested in increased production in the company with a view to obtain bonus and the report further shows that the Enquiry Officer believed this evidence and came to the conclusion that the assault was motivated by this hostility between Raghavan and C A Augustine ,ANALYSIS
9084e381411f452db9c6ac1f9875c954,11468,11556,In fact the charge framed clearly suggested that the assault was made for that motive ,ANALYSIS
cdbe7019e6ea48e6a3779f102030c575,11557,11731,It was alleged in the charge that Augustine was assaulted to terrorise the workmen who had been responsible for giving increased production under the incentives bonus scheme ,ANALYSIS
908405809c954c2984bacb3e98f7c295,11732,11804,According to the charge such acts were highly subversive of discipline ,ANALYSIS
ba414ed5994b4b49ab865ebdba3c8953,11805,11947,The Enquiry Officer has held that in the light of the evidence given by M M Augustine andK T Joseph the charge as framed had been proved ,FAC
50c9b517c0754017b5a8c8e1ae2f2e13,11948,12263,This finding clearly means that the assault was not the result of a purely individual or private quarrel between the assailant and his victim but it was referable to the difference of opinion between the two in regard to the introduction of the incentive bonus scheme on which the two unions were sharply divided ,ANALYSIS
3a9a76ea43164710b2652622e755f11a,12264,12462,Therefore if Raghavan assaulted Augustine solely for the reason that Augustine was supporting the plea for more production that cannot be said to be outside the purview of standing order 22 viii ,ANALYSIS
bfb1d3f9ee2f454ab338c2cd4756650e,12462,12861, The next point which needs to be considered arises out of a plea which has been strenuously urged before us by Mr Menon that the Tribunal was justified in holding that the Enquiry Officer did not conduct the enquiry in accordance with the principles of natural justice and so the Tribunal was entitled to go into the evidence itself and decide whether Raghavan s dismissal was justified or not ,ARG_RESPONDENT
bd7a4c57fc594eb8b67b5d6c1b1dc63f,12862,12912,The legal position in this matter is not in doubt ,ANALYSIS
d6d624c2bbf44ac7b25de48ea85e9b60,12913,13312,If it appears that the domestic enquiry was not conducted in accordance with the principles of the natural justice and a reasonable opportunity was not for instance given to Raghavan to lead evidence in support of his defence that would be a valid ground on which the Tribunal can discard the finding of the domestic enquiry and consider the matter on the merits uninfluenced by the said finding ,ANALYSIS
d640381c6c124e3e8e6b8aa8623bf1b3,13313,13548,Unfortunately for the respondent however on the material on record it is very difficult to sustain the finding of the Tribunal that the Enquiry Officer did not conduct the enquiry in accordance with the principles of natural justice ,ANALYSIS
cbdf7ea002b44d18be289dd66ea1cfe2,13549,13680,The whole of this contention is based on the fact that Raghavan wanted to examine two witnesses Messrs M P Menon and Chalakudi ,ANALYSIS
9193318bca5d4625b58bf68136a82d5e,13681,13850,It appears that Raghavan told the Enquiry Officer that he wanted to examine these two wit nesses and he requested him to invite the said two witnesses to give evidence ,ANALYSIS
612c73dcdeb54e3d8bea32cecbffee82,13851,14020,The Enquiry Officer told Raghavan that it was really not a part of his duty to call the said two witnesses and that Raghavan should in fact have kept them ready himself ,ANALYSIS
e7c163b514f142c7960995e7788f9ea9,14021,14114,Even so in order to assist Raghavan the Enquiry Officer wrote letters to the two witnesses ,ANALYSIS
03195f7537634c029eeaac5d89dce721,14115,14366,Mr Menon replied expressing his inability to be present before the Enquiry Officer and the Enquiry Officer communicated this reply to Raghavan so that for Raghavan s failure to examine Menon no blame can be attributed to the enquiry officer at all ,ANALYSIS
0f3852c0a77440ac9bf80239be755645,14367,14549,In regard to Chalakudi it appears that he sent one letter addressed to the Enquiry Officer and it reached him on the 31st December 1955 the day on which he was leaving for Bombay ,ANALYSIS
f6efb51c6af648189c52d6a2c06bd6dd,14550,14737,This letter was not signed and so the Enquiry Officer took no action on it and gave no time to Chalakudi to appear three or four days later as had beensuggested in that unsigned letter ,ANALYSIS
c20c1f546e634a09a0938c74d23268c8,14738,14898,The Tribunal thought that this attitude on the part of the Enquiry Officer was unsympathetic and that introduced an element of Unfairness in the enquiry itself ,ANALYSIS
18dd554a24494cd89ead14cbdd871dab,14899,14988,We are unable to appreciate how such a conclusion can follow on facts which are admitted ,ANALYSIS
da10b919c46241d197f21bc2985818ee,14989,15086,We do not think the Enquiry Officer was called upon to accept an unsigned letter and act upon it ,ANALYSIS
e8416800a401452ea8484d7f34c2eb54,15087,15386,Besides the Enquiry Officer had gone to Ernakulam from Bombay for holding this enquiry because the respondent Union itself wanted that the enquiry should be held by some other officer outside the local station and it was known that the Bombay Officer would go back as soon as the enquiry was over ,ANALYSIS
f4907ab3e7654a92a16e86e1e5a73b75,15387,15613,In such a case if Raghavan did not take steps to produce his witnesses before the Enquiry Officer how can it be said that the Enquiry Officer did not conduct the enquiry in accordance with the principles of natural justice ,ANALYSIS
18dc13c141f3489d8523ea74bfc10882,15614,15773,Mr Menon has suggested that the Enquiry Officer should have taken steps to get the witnesses M P Menon and Chalakudi brought before him for giving evidence ,ANALYSIS
a844c418ae8e4bf0b895d07ea5bcddee,15774,15811,This suggestion is clearly untenable ,ANALYSIS
74dd28201d2e4141a108f2bac06109ad,15812,16068,In a domestic enquiry the officer holding the enquiry can take no valid or effective steps to compel the attendance of any witness just as the appellant produced its witnesses before the officer Raghavan should have taken steps to produce his witnesses ,ANALYSIS
3fc7ae71beaf499ba0d441e5d90d7b82,16069,16328,His witness Menon probably took the view that it was beneath his dignity to appear in a domestic enquiry and Chalakudi was content to send an unsigned letter and that too so as to reach the Enquiry Officer on the day when he was leaving Ernakulam for Bombay ,ANALYSIS
343fb29b67c54369a107ef2cef277841,16329,16485,It would be unreasonable to suggest that in a domestic enquiry it is the right of the charge sheeted employee to ask for as many adjournments as he likes ,ANALYSIS
213b24068bf44c3caf2dcf60309f794a,16486,16896,It is true that if it appears that by refusing to adjourn the hearing at the instance of the charge sheeted workman the Enquiry Officer failed to give the said workman a reasonable opportunity to lead evidence that may in a proper case be considered to introduce an element of infirmity in the enquiry but in the circumstances of this case we do not think it would be possible to draw such an inference ,ANALYSIS
a65e15228d564e419df076a41a823894,16897,17063,The record shows that the Enquiry Officer went out of his way to assist Raghavan and if the witnesses did not turn up to give evidence in time it was not his fault ,ANALYSIS
e3c1b7e1533e4d0aa16002880c66eb79,17063,17261, We must accordingly hold that the Tribunal was in error in coming to the conclusion that the enquiry suffered from the infirmity that it was conducted contrary to the principles of natural justice ,ANALYSIS
23daac2c79784f9c9248e745ceefce40,17262,17371,Let us then consider whether the dismissal of Raghavan is actuated by malafides or amounts to victimisation ,ANALYSIS
4b0b68f6c8754bfa8cd4c9049094e3ce,17372,17469,In regard to the plea of victimisation the Tribunal has definitely found against the respondent ,ANALYSIS
ca54c97a61534a2a81ac6675f02f24d4,17470,17579, I do not for a moment believe says the Tribunal that the management foisted acase against the ex worker ,ANALYSIS
77883ed3d665486b8575a3513621fd38,17580,17772,Regarding the allegation of victimisation there is no sufficient evidence in the case that the management or its Manager Mr John was motivated with victimisation or unfair labour practice ,ANALYSIS
c932d4762c9847d6af8815c142b8f8c8,17773,17830,This finding is quite clearly in favour of the appellant ,ANALYSIS
ea8378fc1333493dbbf8232a016dee81,17831,18001,The Tribunal however thought that because the Enquiry Officer did not give an adjournment to Raghavan to examine his witnesses that introduced an element of malafides ,ANALYSIS
7a7e49b918a9462483e1dd6f2ab62a7a,18002,18247,It has also observed that since the case against Raghavan did not fall within the purview of standing order 22 viii and yet the appellant framed a charge against Raghavan under that standing order that introduced another element of malafides ,ANALYSIS
7914914942534678af597be647a2221f,18248,18346,It is on these grounds that the conclusion as to malafides recorded by the Tribunal seems to rest ,ANALYSIS
82a31f6d882f4015a195d77d6c645343,18346,18521, In regard to the first ground we have already held that the Tribunal was not justified in blaming the Enquiry Officer for not adjourning the case beyond 31st December 1955 ,ANALYSIS
6931a1449f6b4926b95a8dab96ea8c1f,18522,18867,In regard to the second ground we are surprised that the Tri bunal should have taken the view that since in its opinion standing order 22 viii did not apply to the facts of this case the framing of the charge under the said standing order and the finding of the domestic Tribunal in favour of the appellant on that ground showed malafides ,ANALYSIS
507ed3a6f31a487688cc5a8cdc337e8e,18868,19138,It seems to us that the Tribunal has completely overlooked an elementary principle of judicial approach that even if a judge or Tribunal may reach an erroneous conclusion either of fact or of law the mere error of the conclusion does not make the conclusion malafiedes ,ANALYSIS
18d1a3cc266141498711d86551fbdcad,19139,19291,Besides as we have just indicated on the merits we are satisfied that the Tribunal was in error in holding that standing order 22 viii did not apply ,ANALYSIS
84f9ae4b00b24d1b82a3862e85f85e9f,19291,19405, Therefore the finding of the Tribunal that the dismissal of Raghavan was malafide cannot possibly be sustained ,ANALYSIS
c02a2d3d94df49ce8496913224dcbf21,19405,19477, There is one more point which has been press Id before us by Mr Menon ,NONE
39f94ced48a949b2a3f2d4f3cf9ab3cb,19478,19805,In Phulbari Tea Estate v Its Workmen 1 this Court has held that even if a domestic enquiry is found to be defective the employer may seek to justify the dismissal of his employee by leading evidence before the Tribunal to which an industrial dispute arising out of the impugned dismissal has been referred for adjudication ,PRE_NOT_RELIED
ebf41af1fb424722b1db4676d720bb9a,19806,20078,Mr Menon contends that by parity of reasoning in cases where the em ployee is unable to lead his evidence before the domestic Tribunal for no fault of his own a similar opportunity should be given to him to prove his case in proceedings before the Industrial Tribunal ,ARG_RESPONDENT
d10f67cffce94ff9b055d8b6f51d7ab8,20079,20131,In our opinion this contention is not well founded ,ANALYSIS
5d2551e3c3134742bca9dba5ec2a0ea1,20132,20551,The decision in the case of Phulbari Tea Estate supra proceeds on the basis which is of basic importance in industrial adjudication that findings properly recorded in 1 1960 1 S C R 32 domestic enquiries which are conducted fairly cannot be re examined by Industrial adjudication unless the said findings are either perverse or are not supported by any evidence or some other valid reason of that character ,PRE_NOT_RELIED
3862a67b75af4dcca51d62c820a107cf,20552,20858,In such a case the fact that the finding is not accepted by the Industrial Tribunal would not necessarily preclude the employee from justifying the dismissal of his employee on the merits provided of course he leads evidence before the Industrial Tribunal and persuades the Tribunal to accept his case ,PRE_NOT_RELIED
8d71ca274bc349bbb81a420d16a163cb,20859,20922,That however is very different from a case like the present ,ANALYSIS
2a017b56e07d40f0811bb42c61e3da56,20923,21046,In the case before us the enquiry has been fair the Enquiry Officer gave Raghavan ample opportunity to lead his evidence ,ANALYSIS
5ab2cc43fc1a44ce856a3f168f261db4,21047,21397,If at reasonable opportunity had been denied to the employee that would have made the enquiry itself bad and then the employer would have been required to prove his case before the Industrial Tribunal and in dealing with the dispute the Industrial Tribunal would have been justified in completely ignoring in the findings of the domestic enquiry ,ANALYSIS
618660d64d7d45deb4b89b20680ed1c9,21398,21554,But if the enquiry has been fairly conducted it means that all reasonable opportunity has been given to the employee to prove his case by leading evidence ,ANALYSIS
36229fd445104bdb9c26058b38a4b7f6,21555,21769,In such a case how can the court hold that merely because the witnesses did not appear to give evidence in support of the employee s case he should be allowed to lead such evidence before the Industrial Tribunal ,ANALYSIS
e0b6fe5b2457486489ef9ca1029f3529,21770,21920,If this plea is upheld no domestic enquiry would be effective and in every case the matter would have to be tried afresh by the Industrial Tribunal ,ANALYSIS
aaf953692be7463b9b0e52aa6e94b389,21921,22107,Therefore we are not prepared to accede to Mr Menon s argument that the Tribunal was justified in considering the merits of the dispute for itself in the present reference proceedings ,ANALYSIS
01586e3b89bd4cfbb5d61600d1a2fb01,22107,22326, Since the enquiry has been fairly conducted and the findings recorded therein are based on evidence which is believed there would be no justification for the Industrial Tribunal to consider the same facts for itself ,ANALYSIS
d3c29a7d9ea04d0f8109488fedfae6d8,22327,22501,Findings properly recorded at such enquiries are binding on the parties unless of course it is known that the said findings are perverse or are not based on any evidence ,ANALYSIS
3cccf1defdc249089c59e37f61668aa3,22501,22560, There is yet another point which remains to be considered ,NONE
ae4999c847274c0796244df01ac3117f,22560,22788, The Industrial Tribunal appears to have taken the view that since criminal proceedings had been started against Raghavan the domestic enquiry should have been stayed pending the final disposal of the said criminal proceedings ,ANALYSIS
1dee9f88d832425dbc41dc03dd3f5253,22788,23114, As this Court has held in the Delhi Cloth and General Mills Ltd v Kushal Bhan 1 it is desirable that if the incident giving rise to a charge framed against a workman in a domes tic enquiry is being tried in a criminal court the employer should stay the domestic enquiry pending the final disposal of the criminal case ,PRE_RELIED
94f5a503d1bc4ca8ad3265e3719a83aa,23115,23394,It would be particularly appropriate to 1 1960 3 S C R 227 adopt such a course where the charge against the workman is of a grave character because in such a case it would be unfair to compel the workman to disclose the defence which he may take before the criminal court ,ANALYSIS
b156875722264da0bb42eb04fe0e80f2,23395,23734,But to say that domestic enquiries may be stayed pending criminal trial is very different from saying that if an employer proceeds with the domestic enquiry in spite of the fact that the criminal trial is pending the enquiry for that reason alone is vitiated and the conclusion reached in such an enquiry is either bad in law or malafide ,ANALYSIS
1840350b73784f5e9dcdd733e0c4a7c0,23735,23825,In fairness we ought to add that Mr Menon did not seek to justify this extreme position ,ANALYSIS
f8adac61c6a443eba02b84e3b63372f6,23826,24053,Therefore we must hold that the Industrial Tribunal was in error when it characterised the result of the domestic enquiry as malafide partly because the enquiry was not stayed pending the criminal proceedings against Raghavan ,ANALYSIS
b6ba9482a7124aac8c472e60ade40c2b,24054,24259,We accordingly hold that the domestic enquiry in this case was properly held and fairly conducted and the conclusions of fact reached by the Enquiry Officer are based on evidence which he accepted as true ,RATIO
fe53b57b9dbc4e6bb04972055f18a056,24260,24393,That being so it was not open to the Industrial Tribunal to reconsider the same questions of fact and come to a contrary conclusion ,RATIO
6afff0ee01414470b52913fc8b882851,24393,24431, The result is the appeal is allowed ,RPC
63e7099146c54cbea47b0ca36d2b2e9d,24432,24557,The order passed by the Industrial Tribunal is set aside and the reference made to it is answered in favour of the appellant ,RPC
dc508daa9c2640f682a1d2ea6d451472,24558,24896,Before we part with this appeal we ought to add that Mr Pai for the appellant has fairly offered to pay ex gratia Rs 1 000 to Raghavan in addition to the amount which has already been paid to him by the appellant in pursuance of the order of this Court granting stay to the appellant pending the final disposal of the present appeal ,RPC

9ecab472beab46eb81a76af60f3283d3,1015,1259,2 The story of the prosecution in brief is that on 19 03 2015 at about 9 30 AM while the SI of Excise Sadar Mobile Sundargarh was performing patrolling duty along with other official staffs at village Nuadihi Sancharpada area Sundargarh ,FAC
ee80136c38a84865936042afc4fbcfb4,1260,1389,During patrolling they found the accused namely Jaishree Kalo was going on the road by holding a plastic jerry cane in her hand ,FAC

5f357e1c227048808833d048e3f69cfd,2748,2990,It was the grievance of the petitioner that even before filing the objections to the said notice the Assessing Officer proceeded to pass a reassessment order confirming its proposal to disallow the input tax credit claimed by the petitioner ,FAC

ee9a9ebe2d184d7bbad5d7d7219bbcb1,3780,3834,Being aggrieved the assessee is in revision petition ,FAC
4c1d0f30460741f18fe457ee78a075dc,3834,4152, 3 Learned counsel Sri T Suryanarayana appearing for the petitioner would contend that no provision under the Act authorises the authorities to disallow the input tax credit at the hands of purchasing dealer wherein the selling dealer has failed to file the sales tax returns and discharge its sales tax liability ,ARG_PETITIONER
9e2ad060f2c448d5b1c413715db34f9e,4152,4269, Denial of input tax credit is not supported by any statutory provision and is contrary to the provisions of the Act ,ARG_PETITIONER
69d0382672024ef68c827cd397e6e8ed,4270,4652,It is contended that input tax credit was supported by valid tax invoices raised by the selling dealers in accordance with the provisions of Section 29 of the Act the petitioner is entitled to claim input tax credit based on the invoices raised by the selling dealers the same having been used in the manufacture of goods and being effected with sales both locally and interstate ,ARG_PETITIONER
fcedb12031f048028a3749a8df3f2d08,4653,4958,It is contended that the Assessing Officer while passing the reassessment order has observed that tax invoices are genuine however denied the input tax credit only for the reason that VAT 100 returns for the year 2005 06 of the selling dealers is not forthcoming in Electronics Filing System EFS 4 ,ARG_PETITIONER
f0b034476f694db9be0410a12a2e59cc,4959,5107,In compliance with the order passed by this Court on 27 02 2017 the respondent State has filed statement of objections on behalf of the respondent ,FAC
f1da122bf4264b2790cb94663430186c,5107,5475, Placing reliance on this statement of objections the learned counsel for the assessee would contend that the respondent has admitted the input tax credit claim allowable in respect of the selling dealer Nos 1 to 3 except for the month of August 2005 in respect of M s High tech industrial gases whereas the same is disallowed in respect of the other four dealers ,ARG_PETITIONER
582b8c95d76140b9bf7192852015e621,5476,5636,As far as dealer No 4 is concerned it is observed that invoices are dated November 2005 hence the input tax credit claimed after four months is not allowable ,ARG_PETITIONER
967cf1f5968d42bb8a6fcccb1daa754c,5637,5711,No reasons are assigned as far as selling dealers No 5 and 6 are concerned,ARG_PETITIONER
208d9d3fe9f6480b8723e15a8b1754db,5711,5953, 5 The learned counsel for the assessee has placed a memo on record along with the returns in Form VAT 100 filed by M s Dalini Enterprises selling dealer No 7 for the tax period April 2005 to March 2006 and the relevant bank statements ,ARG_PETITIONER
647f0f6af54243ca8acc0c801c0d1e3e,5954,6291,Based on the said returns learned counsel would point out that major portion of the input tax credit claimed was for the purchases made from the said selling dealer No 7 who has filed the monthly returns for the tax period 2005 06 and remitted tax to the treasury which is manifest from the statement of accounts of the selling dealers ,ARG_PETITIONER
c8d5d2c13ce24041a968cbc8ce99dd04,6292,6410,On these grounds the learned counsel seeks to set aside the order impugned herein by allowing the revision petition ,ARG_PETITIONER
68c7cfff6c5141a0b21518e578b1b638,6410,6596, 6 Learned AGA appearing for the respondent would emphasize that the burden lies on the assessee to prove that the tax collected was deposited by the selling dealers to the Government ,ARG_RESPONDENT
ecdd9eb9c3a84316a1aa3455624324dd,6597,6869,Reliance is placed on Section 70 of the Act to contend that for the purposes of any claim to input tax under the Act the burden of proving that any transaction of a dealer is not liable to tax or any claim to deduction of input tax is correct shall lie on such dealer ,ARG_RESPONDENT
ec9ea050da0643a8b8851acc534acd58,6870,7340,It is pointed out that in pursuance of the directions issued by this Court the department has examined the matter in detail and on verification it was found that some of the selling dealers had filed the returns hence it is decided to extend the benefit of input tax credit as claimed in respect of selling dealer Nos 1 to 3 and the same is denied in respect of selling dealer Nos 4 to 7 as mentioned in the table appended to Para No 3 of the statement of objections ,ARG_RESPONDENT
9ca25b9f14a144b0ba3f43253a2e0b62,7341,7434,It is submitted that the dispute has been reduced to Rs 6 14 200 as against Rs 15 05 332 ,ARG_RESPONDENT
58414d3b28794579aaf63ea1cc50b537,7435,7680,The learned AGA would submit that the returns filed by the selling dealers No 4 to 7 has not been traced to locate the factual position as regards the payment of tax made by these dealers as the relevant period in question is beyond eight years ,ARG_RESPONDENT
341de9c3f2634892bd0451ad5a5f5301,7681,7959,Thus it is submitted that the authorities are justified in rejecting the claim of input tax credit in respect of selling dealer Nos 4 to 7 since no relevant material was placed on record by the assessee to prove the tax being remitted to the Government by the selling dealers ,ARG_RESPONDENT
fe4d8912c1094943af57d42f6f3fc01c,7959,8125, 7 We have given our anxious consideration to the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the respective parties and carefully perused the material on record ,NONE

b4cd35cd06134fa79fde2287c0602cf5,11838,12214,Thus it is categorically admitted that in respect of selling dealer Nos 1 to 3 assessee is entitled to the input tax credit as regards the selling dealer No 7 is concerned now the assessee has filed the income tax returns filed by the said dealer along with bank statements which prima facie shows that the selling dealer has remitted the collected tax from the assessee ,ANALYSIS
d6d465af01bd4607b0d85fa11d9f51d0,12215,12355,The assessee has utilized the goods purchased from the selling dealers for the manufacture of goods and effected local and interstate sales ,ANALYSIS

3cec5f8042ad4979ad1f1d855555f13e,12567,12789,The said judgment of Centum supra was held in a different context wherein the issue was failure to claim input tax credit in the tax periods in which purchases were effected and the claim made in the subsequent periods ,PRE_NOT_RELIED
a86fc8ba06db459cbef79c0a5a679087,12790,12970,In that context it was held by the co ordinate bench of this Court that the claim cannot be made subsequently but in the instant case the issue involved is altogether different ,ANALYSIS
5668b55e73c14ada940889c7013c8e92,12971,13105,The main ground for denying the input tax credit is that the VAT 100 returns filed by the selling dealers are not traceable under EFS ,ANALYSIS

e51f223c8d114476b15cb4adba87ab2e,13459,13755,What is contemplated under Section 70 of the Act is for the purposes of payment or assessment of tax or any claim to input tax under the Act the burden of proving that any transaction of a dealer is not liable to tax or any claim to deduction of input tax is correct shall lie on such dealer ,ANALYSIS

1213dc5bf9c6413e8f5f251b85fa4214,13842,14104, 10 The limited ground on which we have to examine the issue on hand is whether the respondent was justified in denying input tax credit benefits to the assessee on the ground that the VAT 100 returns filed by the selling dealers are not traceable under EFS ,ISSUE
cd4c7f51c1e740d389f162804378feff,14105,14553,It is trite that the revenue can be at a loss in allowing the input tax credit to a dealer who deals with a bogus transaction for example a selling dealer who is not in existence or a de registered dealer in such circumstances it is not in doubt that unless the purchasing dealer establishes the genuineness of the invoices issued by the selling dealer no input tax credit can be allowed but that is not the case in the present set of facts ,RATIO
c28d3d734f154c72a1f5bbc05e36734f,14554,14821,The Assessing Officer while passing reassessment order has categorically observed that the invoices are genuine and in view of the material placed before this Court with respect to the selling dealer No 7 the matter requires reconsideration by the Assessing Officer ,RATIO
bd83c5caa125477dbb5239db3970134c,14822,14944,Even as regards the selling dealer Nos 4 to 6 no reasons are assigned by the respondent for denying the input tax credit ,RATIO
435036877a5a452eaa75aafb4ff111c7,14945,15100,It is also trite that no input tax credit can be disallowed on the premise that the selling dealer is de registered subsequent to the relevant tax periods ,RATIO
e622e2457830429db5230b227b30f6d1,15101,15294,The cause shown for disallowance with respect to selling dealer No 7 is that the said concern has been de registered in 2007 returns are not traced and input tax credit claim is not allowable ,RATIO

f436a83f7f0143729277f56bad1b2409,9546,9732,Further coming to the medical evidence of injuries of victim it is admitted by P W 6 Medical Officer that the injuries of P W 4 can be caused by falling on a construction work place ,ANALYSIS
2e24095f7c464931939eee638b6466d2,9733,9997,Now coming to the evidence of P W 4 informant cum victim it is seen that though P W 4 has corroborated to the contents of the FIR and proved the said FIR vide Ext 1 but he cannot said who had scribed the FIR which creates a suspicion regarding the FIR itself ,ANALYSIS
932b41917faf43c29d78f03cb5dc2996,9998,10210,It is an admitted fact by P Ws 4 and 5 that many people were gathered at the spot when the occurrence took place but none of them have been examined by the prosecution to bring forth the truth before this Court ,ANALYSIS

efdcb4945bfb467fa5646dfc51558a8b,10292,10635,Keeping in view the facts and essential ingredients of the alleged offence I am of considered view that the accused persons cannot be convicted solely basing upon the evidence of victim P W 4 as there are many loopholes in the case of the prosecution and the testimony of P W 4 cannot be relied upon without having any strong corroboration ,ANALYSIS
486338772a5c4099bd933e1daec814d9,10636,10857,Moreover the other P Ws have also not supported or corroborated the version of P W 4 informant cum victim except P W 5 occurrence witness but his testimony could not relied upon as there are material contradictions ,ANALYSIS
e52ed37880ee4890bd1c50feca9e90c8,10858,11009,Therefore the prosecution has miserably failed to establish any of the essential ingredients of the offences punishable U s 384 506 341 323 294 34 8 ,ANALYSIS
14e6c83a0a4c480bbec65011b0918908,11010,11196,In the present case after analyzing the evidence I find it fair enough to acquit the accused persons on the ground that prosecution has miserably failed to prove the occurrence itself ,RATIO

2128319db08247f98f5a22b18c6c446b,4174,4509,It was alleged that accused nos 3 and 4 had abetted accused nos 1 and 2 in assaulting and causing injuries to the victims and therefore it was alleged that the accused had committed offences punishable under Sections 323 504 109 and 307 read with 34 of the Indian Penal Code 1860 Hereinafter referred to as IPC for brevity 3 ,FAC

1219247d154c4e24ab8cc90aacd66021,4883,4996, Thereafter the prosecution had examined 18 witnesses and had got marked 24 exhibits and other material objects ,FAC
8f515baa4b19485d97cc2d70dea6b5c5,4997,5287,Thereafter the court below had framed the following points for consideration 1 Whether the prosecution proves beyond all reasonable doubts that on 18 6 2010 at 6 p m at Varandha of Rudraswami Math at Hunshikatti village when the complainant and Siddayya were present cleaning the dust,ISSUE
ef19936f443e48c1845994b8c5f67812,5287,5740, at that time accused Nos 1 to 4 in prosecution of their common intention by keeping the grudge against the complainant and said Siddayya for the previous quarrel which took place in between them on 17 6 2010 abused the said Rudravva and Siddayya in filthy language and there by gave provocation to them knowing that such provocation would cause them to break the public peace and there by committed an offence punishable u s 504 r w sec 34 of IPC 2 ,ISSUE
fa454965e9d242b2b437f97de1c163e2,5741,6462,Whether the prosecution proves beyond all reasonable doubts that the accused on the above said date time and place further in prosecution of their common intention at the instigation of A3 and A4 A1 came holding Koyata in his hand abused Siddayya and at that time the complainant came to rescue the said Siddayya and in that process A1 gave blow on the fore arm above the elbow of left hand of the complainant and caused injuries to the complainant and on hearing this Paravattewwa came to rescue the complainant and Siddayya at that time A1 also gave blow with Koyata on the head of said Paravatewwa and there by caused injuries to them and accused have committed an offence punishable u s 323 r w sec 34 of IPC 3 ,ISSUE

9ac4902889034144a0734bd3c55ae726,7219,7310,The court below had answered all the points in the negative and the accused were acquitted ,FAC
7f35f2e6544f4a618674f3fa735f3bf0,7311,7372,It is that which is the subject matter of the present appeal ,FAC
eb42f58829014ea99214aa22f6950757,7372,7622, 4 The learned Additional State Public Prosecutor in advancing the arguments in favour of the appellant State would contend that there is no proper appreciation of evidence by the court below and therefore erroneous conclusions have been drawn ,ARG_PETITIONER
8ebf21a74d674190b5eb6b4b1007074d,7623,7731,It is urged that PWs 1 and 6 were injured witnesses and PW 8 was an independent eye witness to the incident ,ARG_PETITIONER
5067e0b3db0d4721b86b882eb1cb2e77,7732,8119,They have in their evidence specifically and categorically narrated the overt acts of each of the accused and the injuries sustained by the victims as being serious in nature all of which have been glossed over by the trial court in seeking to point out certain minor inconsistencies in the evidence of the said witnesses and therefore the same has resulted in a miscarriage of justice ,ARG_PETITIONER
eb27aa6d4baf4d5490a5b9b01d51850e,8119,8465, In this regard the learned Additional State Public Prosecutor takes us through the record to emphasize and demonstrate that the prosecution had certainly proved its case beyond all reasonable doubt and the court below was in error in acquitting the accused in the face of cogent material evidence in support of the charges against the accused ,ARG_PETITIONER
86c906684b5845609db8ff20acfe9fee,8467,8683,5 The learned Counsel for the respondent accused on the other hand would point out that what has been referred to as minor infirmities and inconsistencies are actually fatal lacuna in the case of the prosecution ,ARG_RESPONDENT
1c80d4f9172f411695cd2b8533c3e4b3,8684,9023,In that there is total contradiction between the evidence of PWs 1 and 6 and since both are injured witnesses who were involved in the same incident at the same time and if there is complete contradiction in their testimony which is not supported by any witness for the prosecution it cannot be said that they are minor inconsistencies ,ARG_RESPONDENT
d8e6b2864aac43f592bf62eb07046304,9024,9082,on the basis of which the court has acquitted the accused ,ARG_RESPONDENT
af2634d631be4387b8397b26b7575e3f,9083,9456,The lack of consistent evidence would go to the root of the matter and since the burden was on the prosecution to establish its case beyond all reasonable doubt it could not be said that the trial court was in error in acquitting the accused on the basis of the infirmities which the trial court has painstakingly analysed in a detailed judgment which cannot be faulted ,ARG_RESPONDENT
f05abd9271eb4fecbdac8964dd7b0a1e,9456,9744, 6 On a consideration of these rival contentions and on close examination of the record it is indeed found that the court below has opined that the prosecution had not placed positive evidence on record because first of all PW 1 had not deposed in terms of the complaint Exhibit P 1 ,ANALYSIS
69f953d3cd8d459ea631a9aec82000ca,9744,9801, He had failed to indicate as to how the dispute started ,ANALYSIS
e2e28f22095e4d34bf43b87eaa4296e3,9802,9973,Further the claim that it was the turn of PW 1 to perform the Pooja had not been demonstrated and the temple at which Pooja was to be performed has a very small entrance ,ANALYSIS
88ff6f41eb044de694e6cd0396ca14c8,9974,10047,According to PW 8 accused no 1 was not carrying any weapon in his hands ,ANALYSIS
6454628b93fd4d5f876a5e6c2a20eda1,10048,10167,It is these infirmities which has prompted the court to hold that the evidence was neither cogent nor was corroborated ,ANALYSIS
736dcb75676e46a7ac4d1b8fe28fe91a,10168,10426,When the evidence of PWs 1 and 8 are juxtaposed as regards the injuries sustained by PWs 1 and 6 and as regards the treatment that was obtained or about first aid that was given to the victims at the Hunshikatti Government Hospital there are contradictions ,ANALYSIS
1c3415105ace4231ab9541fd7cc9d3a8,10427,10660,It is also found that the prosecution has failed to examine three crucial witnesses namely Thayamma Shantavva and Mohan Uppin who are said to have shifted the injured to KLE Hospital Belgaum from Hunshikatti Government Hospital ,ANALYSIS
154b755e60c14b34afef0225ac57078c,10661,10718,The statements of those witnesses were also not recorded ,ANALYSIS
d1e2417b3adf41ffaec99873a811a6ba,10718,11292, 7 Yet another doubtful circumstance was the version of PWs 1 and 6 which are totally contradictory to each other whereby PW 1 has stated about the first aid treatment provided at the Hunasikatti hospital in that it was Dr Patil who had provided treatment and PW 6 has stated that their wounds were bandaged and they were on saline drips after they were referred to the KLE Hospital and that the first aid was provided at the KLE Hospital Belgaum and this was totally contradictory to the evidence of PW 12 who was a doctor who had provided treatment to PWs 1 and 6 ,ANALYSIS
75df32a63a05469dacc6f8fe544aa428,11293,11502,Further the wound certificates Exhibits P 10 and P 11 did not mention the nature of the weapon that was used in causing the alleged injuries and Exhibits P 12 and P 13 referred to the weapon used as a sickle ,ANALYSIS
90cd65d6891643159ebccc82334ada4b,11503,11602,But the case of the prosecution itself was that accused no 1 had assaulted PW 1 and 6 with a koita ,ANALYSIS
9ad1508312834921ac61a74b2f9584db,11603,11684,The court has pointed out that there is vast difference between koita and sickle ,ANALYSIS
b817f09308fd451fa8a0a534856798e7,11685,11846,To fill up this gross contradiction as to the definition or the nature of the weapon PW 12 has sought to provide an explanation to reconcile the contradiction ,ANALYSIS
dfac9afba5ed4b3bb9ddff372d65d3db,11847,11944,But that would not clear the doubt that has created about the nature of the weapon that was used ,ANALYSIS
b06ee15f90d0459e9875e5bf703049e9,11945,12253,It is also pointed out by the court below that according to the Medical Practitioner who had tendered evidence namely PW 12 who was a private doctor and who has also stated in his evidence that insofar as the injuries mentioned in Exhibits P 10 and P 11 may be caused even if a person falls from a ladder ,ANALYSIS
da1766c2b4f8465ab7efd34201ac30dc,12254,12409,Whereas the case of the prosecution was that the injuries were caused with a koita by accused no 1 which is also a circumstance which cannot be reconciled ,ANALYSIS
c796b59b371e47feb52e9aaf0a12e298,12410,12554,As the injuries that may be caused in falling from a ladder would be completely of a different nature than those which may be caused by a koita ,ANALYSIS
4877395ca49846cdae1caf3ada3963e6,12555,12605,This again the court finds as an odd circumstance ,ANALYSIS
cbd1741d7cef44689300c9da6242855f,12606,12802,The medical evidence repeatedly referred to the weapon as a sickle throws a serious doubt about the weapon that was used and MO 1 the alleged koita which was seized and having been sent to PW 12 ,ANALYSIS
916018ae42a84d148be4e34492428d4d,12803,13284,It is noticed that there was more than two months delay in submitting the same for such inspection by PW 12 and there is some confusion even as regards the same in view of PW 15 having said that MOs 1 and 2 were sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory Belgaum through PWs 16 on 8 9 2010 and the authority of the Forensic Science Laboratory FSL having returned the same after examination and therefore the said weapons were in the custody of the FSL as per the charge sheet note ,ANALYSIS
7d0ad8fa4e57408c9664a0bfeaa8b3a3,13285,13595,In this circumstance the trial court has pointed out that PW 12 having received MO 1 for examination on 8 9 2010 when the weapon was actually lying with the FSL Belgaum was a remote possibility and this was a doubtful circumstance which again was not sought to be reconciled or explained by the prosecution ,ANALYSIS
75da75b0113e4243b23298b616ccedad,13596,14028,As regards the scene of occurrence it is found by the court below that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the same because the panch witness had all turned completely hostile and has not supported the case of the prosecution as to the place of the incident and the total contradiction of the testimony of PWs 1 and PW 6 regarding the incident is also a circumstance which has proved fatal to the case of the prosecution ,ANALYSIS
a0e7c4051b9546358705e45ae1f588e8,14029,14268,In this manner the trial court has pointed out other infirmities as regards the investigation the spot sketch the panchanama the recovery of incriminating material all of which was found to be irregular and not in accordance with law ,RATIO
e79bbeb6919147af9d1f41d98fc4861c,14269,14522,And particularly the prosecution having failed to prove the mens rea on the part of the accused and in the absence of any criminal background of the accused the court below has rightly negated the case of the prosecution and has acquitted the accused ,RATIO
9f75106bab704b7ba8d38464a5054aed,14522,14614, 8 We do not find any fault committed by the trial court in its well considered judgement ,RPC
55c74ab7dc25418fa6254b83adfb79f6,14615,14639,The appeal is dismissed ,RPC

c69eddfaa7b84270bb3ebf8ac8dd4e95,4059,4232,He submitted that the ITAT ought not to have remanded the matter to the TPO as the material on record before the ITAT was sufficient to arrive at a conclusion on this issue ,ARG_PETITIONER
ac6d7400647e43b3b72cbeb2564db18d,4232,4446, 14 Mr Sanjay Kumar on the other hand submitted that it was the Assessee s own case before the ITAT that in the absence of facts and figures the matter should be sent back to the TPO for a fresh determination ,ARG_RESPONDENT

36f15747144648c89d8de9128fad63c2,5067,5275, 15 The decision in Le Passage to India Tour Travels P Ltd supra turned on the fact that there was no determination by the TPO in the first place whether there was an international transaction ,ANALYSIS

9c0be44421494ea19f62f67c69b5c7dc,5758,6005,16 This Court in Sony Ericsson India Pvt Ltd supra categorically found that the BLT was not an appropriate yardstick for determining the existence of an international transaction or for that matter for calculating the ALP of such transaction ,PRE_RELIED

522d18a7a68d4f98afb470337756b4c1,15322,15671,It is significant that in answer to the last question put to Daryao Singh appellant in the Committing Magistrate s Court under Section 342 Criminal Procedure Code whether he had nothing else to say the first thing that came to his mind was that Asa Ram P W 1 and Bijai P W 10 and Raghubir deceased had killed his father about 15 years ago ,ANALYSIS
6eaa87b4eec5415b85debde1a87e4b0b,15671,15710, The defense case seemed quite absurd ,ANALYSIS
37327c20b4734e6d9572af4b2c29b9a3,15711,15897,It was that Asa Ram and Bijai and Asghar after having killed Mukhtara and Raghubir haul come and attacked the three injured appellants at the time and place given by the prosecution ,ANALYSIS
78f595c4f62343b4b98881ae0ba5074b,15897,16212, Their defense witness however in an obvious attempt to explain the injuries of the three appellants put forward the entirely new version that when Asa Bijai and Asghar were killing Mukhtara and Raghubir the three injuries appellants had attempted to save the murdered men and were injured as a consequence ,ANALYSIS
70e996fb78754bec8d05be4a3d1dea90,16213,16282,The accused had even filed a First Information Report on these lines ,ANALYSIS
57b37b53ed9e438a968c02793e9223c6,16283,16520,They unsuccessfully tried to prosecute Asa and Bijai and Asghar who could not as the Trial Court and the High Court had rightly observed be expected to run berserk suddenly and attack persons on their own side for no explicable reason ,ANALYSIS
34ebfd84bb294ef59fee5b6b64b10a6b,16520,16972, The prosecution had in addition to examining injured witnesses mentioned above produced Rattan Singh P W 2 Kalu P W 9 and Lakhi P W 7 whose testimony was discarded by it on two grounds firstly because each one was shown to have some enmity with some accused person and secondly because they were said to have been standing at a Harat nearly 400 paces away from where according to the High Court they could not have seen the occurrence ,ANALYSIS
32504c1e3d474877a756c68c929e3266,16973,17164,If there was no obstruction to the range of vision and none was shown by evidence these witnesses could at least make out the number of assailants from this distance as sunlight was there ,ANALYSIS
eefa28271e3e497faa75ebd8138c646b,17164,17236, The prosecution evidence suffered from some quite obvious infirmities ,ANALYSIS
6595c44b4fb9428cb032b7985bf31ea4,17237,17474,Each of the four injured eye witnesses while naming each of the eighteen accused persons as participants in the occurrence and specifying their weapons without any contradiction had failed to assign any particular part to any of them ,ANALYSIS
4d85fcce43104a43af3d3385821dcc04,17475,17607,Each injured witness said that all the eighteen accused persons named in the First information Report were assaulting the injured ,ANALYSIS
4cc291e4a74e4dae9279326552583fde,17608,17736,This was hardly consistent with either the medical evidence or the very short time the whole occurrence was said to have lasted ,ANALYSIS
4196273881e448d79a64a18b3f1c1cd4,17737,17853,It was physically impossible for all the eighteen accused persons to attack simultaneously each of the five victims ,ANALYSIS
f896a5fedc094db0b65722a7cba884c5,17854,18062,However we cannot interpret the impressions of rustic witnesses sought to be conveyed through their statements as though they were made in carefully drawn up documents calling for a literal interpretation ,ANALYSIS
b7092d452ac048a5a1f8cf9267c12232,18063,18299,It was likely that each of them had seen some acts of some assailants but due to natural discrepancies in their accounts as each could only depose the part he had observed each had been instructed to omit this part of his testimony ,ANALYSIS
ba75411f6164498fa61426364440842c,18300,18479,That may explain how each consistently stated that all the accused persons were attackinghis or her party although he or she could not specify which accused attacked which victim ,ANALYSIS
85e9391a186f459cb720d39ba3554f2f,18480,18717,From the manner in which each witness could without making any mistake name each of the eighteen accused persons almost in the same order and specify the weapon each carried without any discrepancy some tutoring could be suspected ,ANALYSIS
bc576f66bb32424f95d90ba85f1fa7be,18718,18873,Nevertheless both the Trial Court and the High Court had reached the definite conclusion that the party of assailants consisted of more than five persons ,ANALYSIS
67d48ad2c52e49e5879593fbc9205e20,18874,19109,It also found that this party was sitting on the boundary of the field of Daryao apparently waiting with their weapons for the buggi carrying Raghubir and Mukhtara and others to reach the spot where they surrounded it and attacked ,ANALYSIS
88bdbcef1bf3484797b8a52e182ad7b8,19110,19338,It was clear from the nature and number of injuries of both sides which we have set out above in extenso that the attacking party must have consisted of more persons than the party of the male victims who were five in number ,ANALYSIS
7ebb16d1cdf441be8a626de56670851b,19339,19423,Even if these five victims were sitting in the buggi they were not all empty handed ,ANALYSIS
7d7e7818312045ddb9a0f25486a56075,19424,19481,Some of them had lathis which they plied in self defence ,ANALYSIS
67c12c8dd8664e5bb52f1ff5e7ad8c62,19482,19639,The number and location of injuries on both sides also indicated an attack by a group of persons which must have surrounded the party traveling in the buggi ,ANALYSIS
aceddc5e7c9547b3b944eb1ab45813ff,19640,19776,Even if two persons are engaged in stopping the buggi and there are two on each of the two sides of the buggi their number would be six ,ANALYSIS
e08ff9cc0b584ecf85b1e8f38fab9bc0,19777,19966,Again even if at least one person is assumed to be the assailant of each of the victims in a simultaneous attack upon them the number of such assailants alone would come to at least six ,ANALYSIS
b5cbdb51db5040418236dd1eb7c2be3f,19967,20141,It is however clear from the injuries on Mukhtara and Raghubir that each was attacked by more than one person because each had injuries with sharp edged weapons and lathis ,ANALYSIS
4c1b9f18c4ca4219ab21b3819043a33e,20142,20275,these facts were enough to come to the conclusion that the total number of assailants could not conceivably have been less than five ,ANALYSIS
4bfa0829104a42af9ecebfa0185f4e6f,20276,20735,The High Court however after giving the benefit of doubt to four of the accused persons on the ground that their cases did not differ from those of the others acquitted came to the obviously correct conclusion that at least the four appellants before us must have taken part in the attack because they admitted their participation in the occurrence which took place at the time and place of the incident in which Raghubir and Mukhtara had lost their lives ,ANALYSIS
c224deec054d422ba77c95e2a8078e92,20736,20809,Three of the accused persons as already indicated had received injuries ,ANALYSIS
b261aece057f4324bf4f10c81cd425b1,20810,20885,On their own version these injuries were sustained in the same occurrence ,ANALYSIS
cbb96d30ab8b47b3b62d6a3de60836ef,20886,21129,If therefore the prosecution version about the broad character of the incident is correct the only question which remained was Against which accused person was the case of participation in the attack established beyond reason able doubt ,ANALYSIS
32595603b6e24001afb3391ae7a0b47a,21129,21344,The High Court came to the conclusion that the admissions of the four accused corroborated by the injuries on the bodies of three OF them left no doubt whatsoever that they were in any case among the assailants ,ANALYSIS
e394322b9ed3417a8b9a4f54d374bb16,21345,21611,The others had merely been given the benefit of doubt lest some injustice is done by relying implicitly on partisan witnesses appearing in a type of case in which the innocent ale not infrequently sought to be roped in with the guilty who are of course not spared ,ANALYSIS
b2ce8f04fa9b4bca96fcad61efc618f2,21612,21844,This did not mean that the total number of assailants was actually less than five as the learned Counsel for the appellants asked us to presume from the fact that fourteen out of the eighteen accused persons were actually acquitted ,ANALYSIS
cea6c2cd196b4cf0a299aa25d24d0c51,21844,22002, It is true that the acquittal of an accused person does raise in the eye of law a presumption that he is innocent even if he was actually guilty ,ANALYSIS
4d00010f0cdb4bdb87dd740ee04a16e7,22003,22144,But it is only the acquitted accused person and not the convicted accused persons who can as a rule get the benefit of such a presumption ,ANALYSIS

ff97b950853f459bbfd2316508059175,3315,3677, This is an appeal against the judgment of the High Court of Orrissa in a reference under s 66 1 of the Indian Income tax Act 1922 hereinafter referred to as the Act and the point for decision is whether income received by the respondent by the sale of trees growing in his forests is agricultural income exempt from taxation under s 4 3 viii of the Act ,FAC
2677447035ec42858db36a1362f03513,3677,3765, The respondent is the proprietor of the impartable zamin of Jaipur in Koraput District ,FAC
f88e3f9ff8134d55b06acfae231fb30f,3766,3891,The estate is of the area of 12 000 sq miles of which 1540 sq miles are reserve forest and 100 sq miles protected forest ,FAC
4dadb9c0feb84b839dc9861cbfd250ea,3892,4034,The respondent derives income from the forests by the sale of timber such as teak salwood lac myrabolam tamarind cashewnuts and firewood ,FAC
a741d0583dd84c5eb491f8c032d55375,4034,4119, There is no178 dispute either as to the receipt of such income or as to its quantum ,FAC
9815f22784b643f4a450432362bc1f31,4120,4175,All tat appears in the account books of the respondent ,FAC
7ae94825f90e46aab1f03bb9660c6b66,4176,4251,The point in controversy is as to whether this income is chargeable to tax ,FAC
10ba32ddfcc748a0abc44d1bc8a2835b,4252,4416,It is the contention of the respondent that this is agricultural income as defined ins 2 1 of the Act and that it is in consequence exempt under s 4 3 viii ,ARG_RESPONDENT
0f43648300c54b2d911a47c31e4e35fd,4417,4773,By his 31 1943 the Income tax order dated January Officer held that the forests in question had not been proved to have been planted by the respondent that the trees were of spontaneous growth and that the income therefrom was not within the exemption under s 4 3 viii and this order was confirmed on appeal by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner ,FAC
886758b9a33b4495b3bd8702440820fe,4774,5221,The respondent took the matter in further appeal to the Appellate Tribunal and there put forward the contention that the Incometax Officer had failed to take into account a letter of the Dewan dated June 3 1942 which gave a detailed account of the operations carried on by the estate in the rearing and maintenance of forests and that on the facts mentioned in that letter his finding that there had been no plantation of trees was errolieous ,FAC
db4ca751324d4271b1e7db5867e847a3,5222,5368,By its order dated April 9 1946 the Tribunal accepted this contention and directed a fresh enquiry into the facts mentioned in the said letter ,FAC
b6d2479f0613437d9f6c48f312dcee43,5368,5448, Pursuant to this order the Income tax Officer again enquired into the matter ,FAC
f8f7be9892294a37a787d618db452bae,5449,5722,He observed that though he gave ample opportunities to the respondent to prove that there was plantation of trees by the estate no materials were placed in proof of that fact and that neither plantation books nor any working plans for timber plantation had been produced ,FAC
16ae65aa06ec43e1a5b9bfb6bd3b1de2,5723,5833,He accordingly held that the forests had grown naturally and that the income therefrom was assessable to tax ,FAC
3971bb4f60144c1abd16e4702e219ba6,5834,5907,On this report the appeal again came up for hearing before the Tribunal ,FAC
d40e22a09d7f4541b42fb669ba4486bf,5908,6273,The main contention urged by the respondent at the hearing was that the facts showed that the forests which had yielded income during the year of account could not have been the virgin forests which had originally grown spontaneously on the hills because they had been periodically denuded by the hill tribes in the process of Podu cultivation carried on bythem ,ARG_RESPONDENT
e25173a9d1e845359269ea3c0754c714,6274,6610,What this Podu cultivation means is thus stated in the District Gazetteer Vishakapatnam 1907 This consists in felling a piece of jungle burning the felled trees and undergrowth sowing dry grain broadcast in the ashes without any kind of tilling for two years in succession and then abandoning the plot for another elsewhere ,ARG_RESPONDENT
60c0a1ea446644f5ba7078842fb48873,6611,6914,The argument of the respondent was that as a result of the Podu cultivation the original forests should have disappeared and that the trees that had subsequently grown into forest and sold as timber must have been planted by human agency and their sale proceeds must accordingly be agricultural income ,ARG_RESPONDENT
36c5f4f41f2945a1a731b55af31a6771,6915,7575,Dealing with this contention the Tribunal observed that though there had been extensive destruction of forests in the process of Podu cultivation nevertheless considerable areas of virgin forests still survived that the evidence of actual cultivation and plantation by the zamin authorities was meagre and unsubstantial that no expenses were shown to have been incurred on this account prior to 1904 that the amount shown as spent during that year was negligible that the trees planted then could not have been the trees sold as timber during the assessment years and that the respondent bad failed to establish facts on which he could claim exemption ,FAC
0c01542b267b4403aa0e75818f274987,7576,7762,It should be mentioned that this order covered the assessments for five years from 1942 43 to 1946 47 the facts relating to the character of the income being the same for all the years ,ANALYSIS
e3ada838edf84825b74efca482aee07e,7763,8019,On the application of the respondent the Tribunal referred the following question for the decision of the High Court Whether on the facts and in the circumstances the income derived from forest in this case is taxable under the Indian Income tax Act ,FAC
0296dbe3985147479fed2cbe654ec38b,8019,8112, The reference was heard by Panigrahi C J and Misra J who answered it in the negative ,RLC
bc96bcc579754fb9aeca21d9c3fd5401,8113,8213,They observed It appears to us that the cases as set out by both parties have been put too high ,RLC
8ef08bd115fc4d7fa01905c0bd8cefba,8214,8374,The department takes the view that unless there is actual cultivation of thesoil the income from the forest trees cannot be regard led as agricultural income ,RLC
1d942c8b154d40ffb5c4e882c2657927,8375,8610,The fact that the assessee has spent some money and planted valuable trees in some areas is not sufficient to free the income out of the extensive forests which owe their existence to spontaneous growth from its liability to taxation ,RLC
7830731eba624284913e303f63510ed1,8611,8904,The assessee on the other hand seeks to create an impression that there is not a single tree of spontaneous growth in these forests and such trees as now constitute forests have sprung up out of the stumps left by the hillmen as a result of the system of I Podu cultivation adopted by them ,RLC
172ad1f2f85c4155a92897ac7010b26a,8905,8990,It appears to us that neither of these claims can be regarded as precise or correct ,RLC
6c373a8f6c094ce9a50c5497efc28dd0,8990,10054, The learned Judges then observed that the forests in the Koraput area had been under Podu cultivation for a long period and that as the result of that cultivation they had practically disappeared even by the year 1870 that the trees had subsequently grown into forests and they had also been destroyed by about the year 1901 and that therefore there could not have been any virgin forest left surviving Then they referred to the fact that the respondent had been maintaining a large establishment for the preservation of the forests and that there had been organised activities 1 in fostering the growth of the trees and preserving them from destruction by man and cattle 2 in cultivation of the soil by felling and burning trees from time to time 3 in planned exploitation of trees by marking out the areas into blocks 4 in systematic cutting down of trees of particular girth and at particular heights 5 in planting new trees where patches occur and 6 in watering pruning dibbling and digging operations carried on from time to time ,RLC
86ef3a15c44a4ecc9a2880f22cc115ac,10055,10362,And they stated their conclusion thus All these and similar operations which have been undertaken by the assessee through his huge forest establishment show that there has been both cultivation of the soil as well as application of human skill and labour both upon the land and on the trees themselves ,RLC
bee982431ff846a39c2b339b8e2b6750,10363,10439,It cannot be assumed therefore that all the trees are of spontaneous growth ,RLC
27810f2194d84df79da77ae74c11eb93,10440,10546,The indications onthe other hand appear to be that most of them are sprouts springing from burnt stumps ,RLC
dcd01fa2d7fd44d48bd82704f2368ccf,10547,10713,There is no basis for the assumption made by the Income tax Department that all the trees are forty years old and that they owe their existence to spontaneous growth ,RLC
c1233782051d48c8addb63fb506c7502,10714,11023,Apart from that it will be noticed that what distinguishes the present case from all the reported decisions is that practically the whole of the forest area has been subjected to process of Podu cultivation spreading over several decades so that it is impossible to say that there is any virgin forest left ,RLC
dcdddeb455a448eaaa29baa20bd08ee6,11023,11417, The onus was certainly upon the department to prove that the income derived from the forest was chargeable to tax and fell outside the scope of the exemption mentioned in Section 4 3 viii In this view they held that the Department had failed to establish that the income derived from the sale of trees was not agricultural income and answered the reference in favour of the respondent ,RLC
3e96ef271df349fba4dfe66a6d7778ff,11418,11559,The learned Judges however granted a certificate to the appellant under s 66 A 2 of the Act and that is how the appeal comes before us ,RLC
9f58df36366f420cab1caedd7d01119e,11559,11752, At the very outset we should dissent from the view expressed by the learned Judges that the burden is on the Department to prove that the income sought to be taxed is not agricultural income ,ANALYSIS
686a6230c7944a9ea7844ee9c82d2c1a,11753,11944,The law is well settled that it is for a person who claims exemption to establish it and there is no reason why it should be otherwise when the exemption claimed is under the Income tax Act ,ANALYSIS
7f22051a3f244cb58ea5ada0cfeeb514,11945,12464,The learned Judges were of the opinion that their conclusion followed on the principle of the law of Income tax that where an exemption is conferred by a statute the State must not get the tax either directly or indirectly and support for this view was sought in the following observations of Lord Somervell L J in Australian Mutual Provident Society v Inland Revenue Commissioners 1 The rule must be construed together with the exempting provisions which in our opinion must be regarded as paramount ,ANALYSIS
c94a20b6899c4b2a8edae4a7149b0b2d,12465,12761,So far as the rule if taken I 1946 1 All E R 528 in isolation would have the effect of indirectly depriving the company of any part of the benefit of the exemption its operation must be cut down so as to prevent any such result and to allow the exemption to operate to its full extent ,ANALYSIS
8f9669e88ffd4277be03ebc715e030dc,12761,12849, These observations have in our opinion no bearing on the question of burden of proof ,ANALYSIS
06080607fc2e4156b474acb9c25fcc64,12850,13065,They merely lay down a rule of construction that in determining the scope of a rule regard must be had to the exemptions engrafted thereon and that the rule must be so construed as not to nullify those exemptions ,ANALYSIS
93ed0806100c40268f9f3e63bc0705f9,13066,13095,No such question arises here ,ANALYSIS
f44407c9b03c4e08a8ac67db76078fce,13096,13308,There is ample authority for the view that the principle that a person who claims the benefit of an exemption has to establish it applies when the exemption claimed is under the provisions of the Income tax Act ,ANALYSIS

d4468538c9a343dc925f22ed6963ae03,17049,17182, But if these basic operations are wanting the subsequent operations do not acquire the characteristic of agricultural operations ,PRE_RELIED
bfd6b71b8bff45cdbd91df80ebe19ada,17182,17489, Dealing with trees which grow wild Bhagwati J observed It is agreed on all hands that products which grow wild on the land or are of spontaneous growth not involving any human labour or skill upon the land are not products of agriculture and the income derived therefrom is not agricultural income ,PRE_RELIED
4c78068dac7a4a31816699827aa9d250,17490,17582,There is no process of agriculture involved in the raising of these products from the land ,PRE_RELIED
231655c4b8c6401bad427f1c3c6962e7,17582,17875, The law being thus settled in order to decide whether the income received by the respondent by the sale of trees in his forests was agricultural income or not the crucial question to be answered is were those trees planted by the proprietors of the estate or did they grow spontaneously ,ANALYSIS
b9eca738b3ed4d6dbca13e9ec2876f7b,17875,18158, If it is the latter it would be wholly immaterial that the respondent has maintained a large establishment for the purpose of preserving the forests and assisting in the growth of the trees because ex hypothes he performed no basic operations for bringing the forests into being ,ANALYSIS
0f67095193ef478eb27f05f016fc31bf,18159,18400,Now the Tribunal has clearly found that there were no plantations of trees by the estate authorities worth the name and that the trees the income from which is the subject matter of the assessments must have been of sponta neous growth ,ANALYSIS
693aa3e8044f4b2cacb51520b3a79037,18401,18498,That is a finding of fact which is binding on the Court in a reference under s 66 1 of the Act ,ANALYSIS
734f18869083472d91cedaa3b29d1fb2,18499,18655,The learned Judges declined to accept this finding because they considered that the Tribunal had not appreciated the true significance of Podu cultivation ,ANALYSIS
9341cab77acd405db6e0eeca04922aec,18656,18696,That in our opinion is a misdirection ,ANALYSIS
5fc945994078491889ff356f8750590f,18697,18884,If the point for decision had been whether the forest was a virgin forest or whether it had subsequently sprung up the evidence relating to Podu cultivation would havebeen very material ,ANALYSIS
fa79614bf5ba4870ba612ffd3a17b90f,18885,19083,But the point for decision is not whether the forests were ancient and primeval but whether they had been planted by the estate authorities and on that the Podu cultivation would have no bearing ,ANALYSIS
ce0b9525c27d4b148ab31cc8b1719a48,19084,19165,As a result of the Podu cultivation the original forests would have disappeared ,ANALYSIS
41de4a6efdf04bb49bbc60bd9442c358,19166,19302,But the question would still remain whether the forest which again sprang up was of spontaneous growth or was the result of plantation ,ANALYSIS
4a980ead7df847dc886ce894897632b1,19303,19463,Now there is no evidence that as and when the jungle had disappeared under Podu cultivation the estate intervened and planted trees on the areas thus denuded ,ANALYSIS
542ec87b09794eabbce324dfc3278fa1,19464,19692,On the other hand the learned Judges themselves found that after the destruction of the original forests in the process of Podu cultivation there was a fresh growth of forests from the stumps of the trees which had been burnt ,ANALYSIS
b45961d9eb8e4549a58233e657c68d07,19693,19794,If that is the fact then the new growth is also spontaneous and is not the result of any plantation ,ANALYSIS
874e4d1e64d046b08cadff2dba93dad5,19794,20244, In fairness to the learned Judges it must be observed that at the time when they heard the reference there was a conflict of judicial opinion on the question whether subsequent operations alone directed to the preservation and improvement of forests would be agricultural operations within s 2 1 of the Act and the view they took was that such operations when conducted on a large scale as in the present case would be within s 2 1 of the Act ,ANALYSIS
6154ae3c76924166a59e49e630fd8714,20245,20381,It was in that view that they observed that it is therefore idle to regard tilling as the sole and indispensable test of agriculture ,ANALYSIS
1d91fe96743c491897343b885fad90f8,20382,20711,The decision of the learned Judges was really based on the view that though trees in the forest had not been planted by the estate authorities the latter had performed subequent operations of a substantial character for the maintenance and improvement of the forest and that in consequence the income was agricultural income ,ANALYSIS
274973af97d941ae918982de18c10822,20712,20872,This view is no longer tenable in view of the decision of this Court in The Commissioner of Income tax West Bengal Calcutta v Raja Benoy Kumar Sahas Roy 1 ,PRE_RELIED
e8ef5d97fb4d4b1781ace9d6a1214844,20872,21393, It is contended by Mr Viswanatha Sastri for the 1 1958 S C R 101 155 158 160 186 respondent that on the facts established in the evidence the proper conclusion to come to is that the trees sold by the respondent had been planted by the estate authorities and that the decision of the High Court that the income thus realised is within the exemption under s 4 3 viii could be supported even on the view of law taken in The Commissioner of Income tax West Bengal Calcutta v Raja Benoy Kumar Sahas Roy 1 ,ARG_RESPONDENT
fa437f756aaf4e77893d34c86075d179,21394,22249,The argument was that there was unimpeachable evidence that the old forests had disappeared under Podu cultivation that the estate had been regularly engaged in planting trees at least from the year 1904 as is shown by the accounts of the zamin that it was a reasonable inference to make that there had been similar plantations even during the years prior to 1904 notwithstanding that no accounts were produced for those years because it would not be reasonable to expect that such accounts would now be available that though the amount shown as spent for plantation might not be considerable that was understandable when regard is bad to the fact that the agricultural operations were conducted on the hills and not on the plains that on these facts it would be proper to conclude that the forests were in their entirety the result of plantation ,ARG_RESPONDENT
ce271460269d4879a59a71f676e868ee,22250,22369,It would be ail erroneous approach it was argued to call upon the assessee to prove tree by tree that it was planted ,ARG_RESPONDENT
d973c2bf388d4bb6b0813ca9ae4e38ed,22370,22546,Now these are matters of appreciation of evidence on what is essentially a question of fact viz whether the trees were of spontaneous growth or were products of plantation ,ANALYSIS
a6c0e51804774205ba1fa2f6f6a7389e,22547,22737,On this the Tribunal has given a clear finding on a consideration of all the material evidence and its finding is final and not open to challenge in a reference under s 66 1 of the Act ,ANALYSIS
fab3fff8c04e47b5be7ec5b1a0116807,22738,23175,Even the learned Judges of the High Court who considered themselves free to review that finding and as already pointed out without justification could only observe that the trees must have mostly grown from the slumps left when the forests were burnt for purposes of Podu cultivations finding which is fatal to the contention now urged for the respondent that they I 1958 S C R 101 155 158 160 were the result of plantation ,ANALYSIS
bfb7dd63872147619540797b6a7dc816,23176,23296,We are of opinion that there are no grounds on which the finding of the Tribunal could be attacked in these proceedings ,ANALYSIS
7499682e40aa4ef49fd0be4aac7e8202,23296,23514, It remains to deal with one other contention urged on behalf of the respondent and that is based on the fact that the amounts spent in the upkeep of the forrests were large in comparison with the receipts therefrom ,ARG_RESPONDENT
887bfcb2f3bc488a969839970ad880cc,23515,23838,The following are the figures relating to the forest receipts and expenses for the years with which the present assessments are concerned Years Receipts Expenses 1942 43 Rs 438 894 Rs 174 437 1943 44 Rs 407 447 Rs 209 895 1944 45 Rs 552 122 Rs 228 830 1945 46 Rs 372 971 Rs 247 216 1946 47 Rs 689 366 Rs 460 369,ARG_RESPONDENT
9aa424e2d64a46afb16164e55d0cb107,23839,24067,The argument is that from the high proportion of the expenses in relation to the receipts it could be inferred that the income from trees planted by the estate formed a substantial portion of the income derived from the forests ,ARG_RESPONDENT
ef44727ae89745b192c6fbb3d36b9bde,24069,24373,And support for this conclusion is sought in the following observations in The Commissioner of Income tax West Bengal Calcutta v Raja Benoy Kumar Sahas Roy 1 The expenditure shown by the assessee for the maintenance of the forest is about Rs 17 000 as against a total income of about Rs 51 000 ,ARG_RESPONDENT
b2c98e5be56e476889ad5de5f772cb2d,24374,24544,Having regard to the magnitude of this figure we think that a substantial portion of the income must have been derived from trees planted by the proprietors themselves ,ARG_RESPONDENT
11b7bf901cdb46f8b01aef6786863b38,24546,24654,To appreciate the true import of these observations we must have regard to the context in which they occur ,ANALYSIS
ae1f6223b9ef4d4e8e7199d7f1cee538,24655,25061,The facts found in that case were that portions of the forest which was originally of spontaneous growth had gradually been denuded that the propritor had planted trees in the areas so denuded that this had gone on for a period of over 150 years and that therefore the whole of the income derived from 1 1958 S C R 101 155 158 160 the forest cannot be treated as non agricultural income ,ANALYSIS
b3dafcc45bbc4b9392eb5dc91bd62a60,25061,25450,It was then observed that If the enquiry had been directed on proper lines it would have been possible for the Income tax authorities to ascertain how much of the income is attributable to forest of a spontaneous growth and how much to trees Planted by the proprietors but that in view of the long lapse of time it was not desirable to remand the case for enquiry into the matter ,ANALYSIS
0b2fca062d724b8385f8b3b41828848e,25451,25805,Then follow the observations on which the respondent relies and when read in the light of the findings that the plantations made by the proprietors were not negligible they mean nothing more than that out of the total income a substantial portion was likely to be agricultural income and that it was therefore not a fit case for ordering fresh enquiry,ANALYSIS
29e9cfbd4d7944d08dcdafeba2039f55,25806,25982,These observations do not lay down that if considerable amounts are expended in the maintenance of forests then it must be held that the trees were planted by the proprietors ,ANALYSIS
7706777f73734b2e977e5ecf132aa187,25983,26162,They only mean that if a considerable portion of the forests is found to have been planted a substantial portion of the forest income may be taken to have been derived therefrom ,ANALYSIS
0e99ecb10c594de5948e49ee26fd95e2,26163,26286,And this too it must be remarked is only a presumption of fact the strength of which must depend on all the facts found ,ANALYSIS
158673fffe114af3a06180a1c16bb6cb,26287,26503,In the face of the clear finding in the present case that the forests with which the assessment years are concerned were of spontaneous growth the observations quoted above can be of no assistance to the respondent ,ANALYSIS
c494c4406f8d4cd68ce86611f73ffbe5,26504,26993,It is scarcely necessary to add that the observations If the enquiry bad been directed on proper lines it would have been possible for the Income tax authorities to ascertain how much of the income is attributable to forest of spontaneous growth and how much to trees planted by the proprietors quoted above cannot be read as was sought to be done for the respondent as throwing on the Department the burden of showing that the income sought to be taxed was not agricultural income ,RATIO
bddb344a0bea488ea48e6913bd6af617,26994,27168,That in their context is not the true meaning of the observations and the law is as laid down in Commissioner of Income tax v Venkataswamy Naidu 1 1956 29 I T R 529 ,RATIO

35a27413f1934e8aa90880a4772d7753,13619,13771,The learned trial Magistrate found all the above heads to have been established and that is why he convicted and sentenced accused No 13 on two counts ,RLC
ebb2739a3b894d17915bd9412e2b4928,13772,13842,The High Court took a different view in relation to heads a and f ,RLC
48b52e24433c48c1b86fad0ef16e29bb,13843,14206,It was of the opinion that the identification of accused No 13 by the Customs officials on the 8th 9th and 13th of September 1966 could not safely be relied upon as they had seen people coming into and going out the Sagar Mandir only from a distance and for very short periods of time so that their view of such people could possibly be mere fleeting glances ,RLC
228af527ad194212bb55c472d4b7b301,14207,14495,It further held the alleged recovery of four gold slabs and 10 gold bangles to be unreliable as the marginal witness to the recovery memo who was produced in court by the prosecution did not support it and stated that he had not seen accused No 13 pointing out the slabs and the bangles ,RLC
82e4da25aeee49b6849c8e58a4ddb47a,14496,14646,The High Court concluded therefore that the charge under clauses a and b of sub section 1 of section 135 of the Customs Act was not sustainable ,RLC
f88851f689d240cdb836e22a944b3fa6,14647,14849,However it found the other heads of evidence proved and on the basis thereof upheld the conviction and sentence in relation to the charge of conspiracy to commit the other offences just above described ,RLC
dfa6e92253564956903a7f1ef5133d0b,14849,15008, 5 After hearing learned counsel for the parties at length we find ourselves unable to uphold the impugned judgment in so far as accused No 13 is concerned ,ANALYSIS
f3b517f296e94775aaa54063d8c2b7f0,15009,15313,The circumstances that he was found peeping into the flat that he tried to run away on seeing the Customs officials searching the premises that he was in possession of duplicate keys of the flat and that he was found wearing a bandi similar to bandi exhibit J 2 are not incompatible with his innocence ,ANALYSIS
822f1dc6fe8b4ea092a76d1e67b4d3d6,15314,15527,He was a close relation of accused No 12 who has been found to the person really incharge of the flat and it would thus be natural for him accused No 13 to share the flat with the permission of accused No 12 ,ANALYSIS
abea04708b9744398e4eea8f2b5530a9,15528,15700,In so living with his brother in law he may have been given to wear the bandi found on his person not for the purpose of carrying gold but just for use as ordinary raiment ,ANALYSIS
0601c8bdd2f64453a9064f38df8960bd,15701,15895,Again in a city like Bombay it is not unusual for persons sharing a particular accommodation to be provided with separate sets of keys for each in order to facilitate ingress or egress at will ,ANALYSIS
4edffa92b08a49dd892e08fb1895433b,15896,16145,Further an innocent man finding his premises being watched by persons in authority may well feel funky at the prospect of a false implication on the basis of a mere suspicion which may or may not be well founded and may try to make himself scarce ,ANALYSIS
64424b1fb17e4d9ca661ae37385a8898,16146,16280,Without more the circumstances covered by heads b c d and e therefore cannot be regarded as incriminating circumstances ,ANALYSIS
1dcf1545be794206accaa2d2c816dc44,16281,16358,So the conviction really rests on the confession attributed to the appellant ,ANALYSIS

46ce089dfa9e41a58520dd4ff3b81f1a,16481,16794,If on the other hand the confession appears to be either untrue in any material particular or having been caused by any inducement threat or promise such as is described in section 24 of the Evidence Act it must fall and with it fall the other heads of evidence leaving no material to support the conviction ,ANALYSIS
3923d5acea824c69afbc7b0b75302124,16795,16988,As it is we find that the appellant has been able to prove the existence of circumstances which make it highly probable that his confession is hit by the mandate in section 24 above mentioned ,ANALYSIS

2593aa25a2e741938f6cb9be920d48e5,17038,17446, 6 The case set up by accused No 13 in so far as his confession is concerned mainly consists of a plea that it was the result of an assault on him by the Customs officers including Ayengar and Sevalia and that the latter had forced him into making an endorsement in his own hand writing under the confessional statement to the effect that statement was voluntary and had been explained to him by Sevalia ,ANALYSIS
04153130e2e0415697b5e1e46f2cc318,17446,17769, Naturally the story of the assault has been stoutly denied by Ayengar and Sevalia but then the circumstances prevailing at the relevant time in the Customs House where the statement was recorded definitely indicate that all was not well with the manner in which the interrogation of various accused was being carried on ,ANALYSIS
640f381d09ed48f5881cec53801e4eec,17770,18086,In this connection the outstanding feature of the situation is the fact that accused No 15 when examined by Dr S R Joglekar D W I on the 16th September 1966 at 6 15 P M was found to have on his person seven injuries which the doctor has described thus 1 Ecchymosis below right eye outer part 1 2 x1 3 ,ANALYSIS

dc8620c7f276480787439da36f5fb40d,18775,18997,No explanation whatsoever is offered for his injuries by the prosecution but the stand taken by accused No 15 himself in this behalf may be stated in his own words At that time there were six Customs Officers around me ,ANALYSIS
b6ae9cba3dd849948b375e174e05f118,18998,19043,In the gallery I was again shown the 4 keys ,ANALYSIS

fec4ff674048442cb7588429ccb3b62e,19215,19272,One of the officers then asked me to take out my clothes ,ANALYSIS
9e81b0fe46724cc79e4e77de0071fceb,19273,19345,I had then worn one under wear and a pant and one bush coat and a ganji ,ANALYSIS

258afc45a98b48ec8701422ffe48cdde,19624,19683,The six officers were then standing around me at that time ,ANALYSIS

e5509c4bbe9b42b1a743c18fb850b7fe,20107,20227,In this way I had fallen and had been assaulted again and again by the said officers for about an hour or so ,ANALYSIS
68a631f3aec74a0ba7355fe5333a9ee7,20227,20401,While I was so being questioned and made to sit in that position again and again one of the officers had gone out and had returned with a ruler in hand having a round shape ,ANALYSIS
813a18d3c37b41e2bc614047e0b9a4eb,20402,20557,As I was made to sit in that position of a chair I often used to move therefrom the officers immediately used to assault me and I used to get up thereby ,ANALYSIS
8f283c82dd7046ff96361afddbcd8e70,20558,20710,Out of the Custom Officers the officer who had the ruler in his hand used to assault me therewith and the other officers used to assault me with kicks ,ANALYSIS
0dc72ad77c9c4f879c226c57b8d6fffb,20711,20902,I had been assaulted with that ruler on my left buttock on my right buttock on the back portion of the calf of my left leg on my right thigh on the backside of my both legs etc ,ANALYSIS
3bf9471692064f4697867846a6f4787c,20902,21030,I had received injuries at all these places stated by me above and as a result of this assault on me I could not even stand up ,ANALYSIS
da56ea20afdb4497b3bac0e5cc0f1a23,21031,21220,Throughout the assault I was being questioned again and again about the said keys by all the said officers and at every time I was stating that I did not know anything more about the same ,ANALYSIS
8cfab11eb8dc486b80c449458ff8b8bd,21221,21296,Thereafter I had fallen down on the ground with my face towards the ground ,ANALYSIS
8eeadd2e8ece4274b8f4934c5c1b898f,21297,21349,All the said six officers then went away ,ANALYSIS
8b84adf32f2246d1ad677b93064eeca7,21349,21871,This stand may not be devoid of exaggeration and embellishment but it receives great support from the testimony of Dr Joglekar D W I so that the probability appears to be that accused No 15 received his injuries at the hands of the Customs staff and there being no explanation on the part of prosecution as to the situation in which he was beaten it is reasonable to presume that the stand taken by him is correct and that the injuries were inflicted on him as a measure of coercion adopted to secure his confession ,ANALYSIS
776eb9300b8f4125853947039a47384f,21871,22144, In coming to a contrary conclusion the High Court was mainly influenced by the fact that although accused No 15 had filed a complaint in court against the concerned officers of the Department of Customs he did not prosecute it but had it dismissed for default ,ANALYSIS
369b4bd8c66242b899eaa711b000b02b,22145,22329,The High Court observed in this connection The only explanation for this unusual attitude offered by him to the Court is that he was afraid of vindicative attitude from the officers ,ANALYSIS
de37147b2598453ba38b2e9857e06d19,22330,22477,We have not been able to conceive how officers could have adopted any vindicative attitude when accused No 15 was not concerned with any offence ,ANALYSIS
69dcafdfc5cb40719a019d02ff0aaef8,22478,22614,Be that as it may the fact remains that the complaint was not prosecuted and the evidence was recorded behind the back of the officers ,ANALYSIS
7309acde162b4b519f670db5bb616d88,22614,22826, It is not possible to hold on the present material that assaulting by the officers was for the purposes of extorting some confession and such assault alone was the cause of the injuries received by him ,ANALYSIS
75a0bcc9257a44208820d8ee729c7051,22827,23129,Beyond therefore creating a fog of suspicion the injuries proved to have been caused to accused No 15 cannot indicate that all the accused were subjected to torture assault and pressure for giving statements to the liking of officers or compelling them to sign the prepared statements ,ANALYSIS
9ab009b9e286407e8d46e7dd97980155,23129,23245,We do not appreciate this approach to the determination of the voluntary nature of the confession of accused No 15 ,ANALYSIS
7dcea0473c8f49568fd42c79ec9623c0,23245,23408, As we have already pointed out the time of infliction of injuries coincided with the day on which accused No 15 was apprehended and his confession was recorded ,ANALYSIS
4275621c011f4b23876b842f1201af1c,23409,23717,In this situation it was the imperative duty of theprosecution to explain the circumstances in which it became necessary for force to be used by the Customs staff on the person of accused No 15 and in the absence of any such explanation there is no reason why his plea should not be taken at its face value ,ANALYSIS

c740e4b4a7074b96a8cf9c05ad177a12,23730,24134,We are of course not directly concerned with the voluntary nature of the confession of accused No 15 in this appeal but the circumstances discussed in the last paragraph indicate that the Custom of officials did not stick to ethical standards in the performance of their duties and on the other hand exhibited such a zeal in bringing the captives to book as transgressed the limits set thereon by law ,ANALYSIS
367b0b88917642fe90fa69cfb705c414,24135,24343,We have already alluded to the fact that the High Court itself did not regard the recovery of four gold slabs and 10 gold bangles alleged to have been made at the instance of accused No 13 to be trustworthy ,ANALYSIS
754f37c276cd4928964b97806f28f694,24344,24569,Besides the plea of accused No 13 that he was coerced into making the confession was taken at the earliest opportunity i e on the 20th of September 1966 which was the day next to that of his release from custody on bail ,ANALYSIS
67b3ab9065ec4c80b3e66bad2ecfe75b,24570,24785,That plea is contained in letter exhibit 29 addressed by him on that date to the Additional Collector of Customs Bombay which contained the following averments From the 14th instant at 12 noon till about 3 p m ,ANALYSIS
a62e73259dc5444c80d9724626eb8a18,24786,25053,I was locked up along in one room with some Customs Officers who continuously interrogated me threatened and physically assaulted me to make and sign a statement prepared by them after ascertaining a few personal questions from me pertaining to my family and myself ,ANALYSIS

a951d7d4af98493fb77ef1461875073d,25161,25332,The statement was written out by the officers themselves in English language and it was not explained to me and my signature was obtained which I have signed in Gujarathi ,ANALYSIS
04edecd1c49943c0a145afb93cf23bea,25333,25492,As a result of this threat coercion and complete exhaustion I had no alternative but to sign the statement after which only I was allowed to rest ,ANALYSIS
d35b1c845e904c6e8bef3647511740e6,25492,25693,Taking note of these circumstances we would consider it extremely unsafe to regard the confession exhibit Z 383 signed by the appellant as having been made by him voluntarily and therefore trustworthy ,ANALYSIS
a1f48d333e9749b389b185a462bc2d60,25694,26098,The appellant in our opinion has shown the existence of circumstances which make it appear to the Court that the confession may well have been obtained in a manner which would bring it within the ambitof section 24 of the Evidence Act it being undisputed that the concerned officers of the Department of Customs were persons in authority within the meaning of that expression as used in the section ,RATIO

24dd4e7f0c1b4e57846d9e0373be6255,13641,13797,This means that an assessee cannot approach the Commission for settlement of his case with respect to income already disclosed before the Assessing Officer ,ANALYSIS

76c18f3be1b94a58b08a83852c5ab973,14980,15343,The words at any stage of a case relating to him only make it clear that the pendency of proceedings relating to that assessment year whether before the Assessing Officer or before the appellate or revisional authority is no bar to the filing of an application under Section 245 C so long as the application complies with the requirements of Section 245 C 12 ,ANALYSIS

e819af8a149d465bae47a7202461d6f6,15763,16023,For this reason the expenditure incurred in extending customary hospitality by offering ordinary meals as a bare necessity is not entertainment expenditure without the aid of the enlarged meaning given to the words by Explanation 2 inserted w e f 1 4 1976 ,ANALYSIS
316b8eecad8748cbb43226b040e9b3a0,16024,16201,The definition in Explanation 2 is not the ordinary meaning of the words entertainment expenditure but the enlarged meaning given for the purpose of the Act w e f 1 4 1976 ,ANALYSIS

aec499698b4b40e3bf875185a062d9eb,16454,16654,The object of the provision clearly is to allow deduction of the essential business expenditure incurred due to commercial expediency and according to the trade usage excluding the lavish expenditure ,ANALYSIS
86313e38d5444e4a910be312764b291f,16655,16840,The dispute in the present cases relates only to the amount which has been held to be essential business expenditure of this kind incurred in providing ordinary meals as bare necessity ,ANALYSIS
0b1d3cc464e7454eac685169b8a486fb,16841,17070,In the view taken by us such expense did not come within the meaning of entertainment expenditure prior to 1 4 1976 when Explanation 2 was brought in by a retrospective amendment made in 1983 of sub section 2A of Section 37 ,ANALYSIS
0f2995cc78c640529733da23fcd2f8a3,17070,17261, The finding of fact in all cases therefore satisfies this test to allow deduction of the expenditure incurred by each assessee and claimed under this head for the period prior to 1 4 1976 ,ANALYSIS

2f0a0a0dbbd9454d9f9cb74f14944e0e,17685,17774,We have therefore to construe sub section 2A as it existed without the Explanation 2 ,ANALYSIS
21c71d88f52a4a00801a6bd109e24d3c,17775,17872,The meaning of Explanation 2 is quite clear and it has enlarged the meaning to widen the tax net ,ANALYSIS
e1b7267117c04b08bdb133a5910b6e41,17872,18061, Learned counsel for the revenue contended that Explanation 2 is clarificatory and therefore even without Explanation 2 the provision must be understood and construed in the same manner ,ANALYSIS
ad4a6fce2c4e48d19af1c7446f3d59aa,18062,18261,It appears to us that insertion of Explanation 2 made retrospectively but restricted in its application only w e f 1 4 1976 is itself an indication that its application prior to 1 4 1976 is excluded ,ANALYSIS
32c2f0fe9cb04fba82fec5a052a61d2c,18262,18474,If Explanation 2 was merely clarificatory of the ordinary meaning as contended by learned counsel for the revenue it was unnecessary to restrict its restrospective application in this manner only from 1 4 1976 ,ANALYSIS
df7ce2e31b2b47fb926639333afd6c19,18475,18709,The construction we have made of sub section 2A of Section 37 as it existed during the relevant assessment period cannot therefore be affected by Explanation 2 to sub section 2A which was inapplicable during the relevant period ,ANALYSIS
73aedf66ee044745b5b1aa2c7d98afd7,18711,18908,In our opinion the construction we have made of the provision as it existed during the relevant period flows not merely from the language of the provision but also matches with the object thereof ,ANALYSIS
391fc716cf0c43699f88ad5a2eda6cff,18909,19328,It means that the expenditure incurred by the assessees in providing ordinary meals to the outstation customers according to the established business practice was a permissible deduction inspite of sub section 2A of Section 37 to which the assessees were entitled in the computation of their total income for the purpose of payment of tax under the Income tax Act 1961 during the relevant period prior to 1 4 1976 ,ANALYSIS

6da828811d134774bbf4d9c78f87931f,4756,4803, 13 The defence examined two witnesses ,ANALYSIS
dd8127679b6949848dc8060e9e5cb79e,4804,5135,The evidence of the defence is that the materials were loaded in the truck and for that they had valid document which the learned trial Court did not believe therefore found taking away of materials by loading in the truck and holding the same to have been stolen as such in the unlawful possession of the accused petitioners ,ANALYSIS
d4b13f8807b44a3ead28a3e255519f44,5136,5396,The evidence on record makes it clear particularly the Ext 4 that there was a challan issued to the accused contractor Raj Kr Gupta to take the materials from the godown for replacement of the slippers of the Railway track as he got a contract therefor ,ANALYSIS
1bb7c2ac6d884635bbf1bd82af452c40,5397,5813,What this Court notices on examination of Ext 4 is that while the first page of the challan was filled up with the particular of materials to be lifted the fourth page thereof was left blank to be filled up at a later point of time although signature of the competent authority of Railway Department was there with impression that it will be filled in after lifting of materials from the godown of the Railways ,ANALYSIS
aacb65db11d24f05bb9d0b33a19e4fe6,5814,6031,But it does not necessarily mean that the accused contractor did not have the valid authority to lift the materials from the Railway Department since his contract was for replacement of slippers of the Railway tracks ,ANALYSIS
c5bc6109ed584f3f9e0dee8c31093141,6031,6248, 14 It appears from the seizure list that the materials seized were all not mentioned in the challan and some of the materials were found to have been lifted without their names being mentioned in the challan ,ANALYSIS
287929fd3e3042d7a768d85a8798c95c,6248,6376, Therefore the materials which were lifted without there being specific mention in the challan were lifted without authority ,ANALYSIS
0eb1060b7a7f45fb85adb7d23b98c83a,6376,6533, 15 That being so the accused petitioner Raj Kumar Gupta who lifted the materials is found guilty of the offence under Section 3 of the RPUP Act ,RATIO
ee18405e18a8482d9d2e90cd431334dd,6534,6721,So far as the remaining accused petitioner Nos 2 to 13 are concerned they were all labourers engaged by the accused petitioner No 1 contractor for loading the materials in the truck ,RATIO
bd4d7553f7a24610a6a7704dcd4929aa,6722,6983,They did not commit theft of the articles and as such it was not in their unlawful possession and if at all it was in the possession of any of the accused petitioners it was Raj Kr Gupta at whose instance the materials were lifted for loading in the truck ,RATIO
6f7e7c6a113e4fa4a6e61e129c947d4d,6984,7094,Therefore in the considered view of this Court the revision petitioner Nos 2 to 13 deserve to be acquitted ,RPC

4db4452780bc43c3a50427206bf7170e,1523,1669, 2 I have heard the learned counsel Sri Aruna Shyam M through virtual hearing and Sri Mahesh Shetty learned High Court Government Pleader 3 ,NONE
4c2e21bbf7d248f5a72ad046dc3e9f06,1670,1813,The gist of the complaint is that on 28 6 2016 at about 2 00 a m the complainant was about to open the gate of his house to park his vehicle ,FAC

92376d7f55654c6c9fe40538f8e65a3d,2664,2890,When the complainant questioned him as to why he should pay so much of money then Naveen Shetty told that he has cheated Rs 20 lakhs to Nataraj Kalmane Chit Fund in a cricket betting and as such he has to pay the said amount ,FAC
93529ebf7aa3428eba9e3716665a9c19,2890,3067, It is further alleged that thereafter they shifted the complainant to another place where accused No 4 petitioner along with Naveen Shetty came and they demanded Rs 10 lakhs ,FAC

ade52a35064448cf9d82cae5fe65a6f3,3446,3521,He further told that the said Naveen Shetty has to be paid the said amount ,FAC
bb01ee4090f04e5685436e8f3cd26a8b,3522,3723,He also gave a mobile number 9480805120 but the said mobile number belongs to Dy S P and he told to bring the said amount near the Police Quarters where he handed over Rs 10 lakhs at about 10 15 p m ,FAC
b735f74ce47d45e38b2b9ac9c3e6a724,3724,3777,On the basis of the complaint a case was registered ,FAC
2175cf8c10284ec1bc1c6778e6875b3f,3779,4036,4 It is the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that already the charge sheet has been filed and since more than two years the petitioner accused is in custody neither the charge has been framed nor any progress has been made in the case ,ARG_PETITIONER
d0a6629c5e2b40bcb4dab31b3c906b1e,4037,4141,It is his further submission that he is having an old aged mother and nobody is there to look after her ,ARG_PETITIONER

25e10b810a81435da76ccbb81bd9fdeb,4737,4895,It is his further submission that the injured complainant alone is the witness in the said incident and his evidence is also not trustworthy and not reliable ,ARG_PETITIONER
f4495a9979454bf8b2ded28e9af3ecab,4896,5175,It is his further submission that only because of cancellation of the anticipatory bail by the Hon ble Apex Court the learned District Judge without even considering the application for cancellation of the bail has rejected the bail and he has been wrongfully taken into custody ,ARG_PETITIONER
f3cc28060d9b4d8fb87a16283f3ba55a,5176,5375,It is his further submission that because of Covid 19 there is no likelihood of progress in the case and continuation of the petitioner accused in custody is going to affect his right and liberties ,ARG_PETITIONER

9ddb41a62ee0489dbd6e7a6806704af0,5599,5933, 5 Per contra the learned High Court Government Pleader vehemently argued and submitted that earlier the petitioner accused has approached this Court in Criminal Petition No 6790 2018 and subsequently in another Criminal Petition No 9456 2018 this Court after considering the merits of the case has dismissed the bail application ,ARG_RESPONDENT
50277f31d782465aa6735c00edccda68,5934,6009,No new grounds have been made out so as to reconsider the bail application ,ARG_RESPONDENT
d3d34c8c1a014585ad171c53a1fabed4,6010,6112,Merely because there is delay in trial the petitioner accused is not entitled to be released on bail ,ARG_RESPONDENT
0487253e65684170b0f2e45c7feec8ed,6113,6401,It is his further submission that the charge sheet material clearly goes to show that it is the petitioner accused who is the main accused and at his instance complainant was kidnapped and the amount has been paid to Deputy Superintendent of Police who has also collected the said amount ,ARG_RESPONDENT
d1f10d282df24e5185c56d4f4623fccb,6402,6466,There is prima facie material as against the petitioner accused ,ARG_RESPONDENT
3c59c0207a33473cb1f567b96a9cebe1,6467,6604,It is his further submission that if the petitioner accused is enlarged on bail he may abscond and he may not be available for the trial ,ARG_RESPONDENT
2455db24640b401e9af91c7b4e69ada9,6605,6656,On these grounds he prayed to dismiss the petition ,ARG_RESPONDENT
b93e585ed1ce4dc0bdbe8922fa43f4a0,6656,6801, 6 I have carefully and cautiously gone through the submissions made by the learned counsels appearing for the parties and perused the records ,ANALYSIS
22cdcf23a92f4083a3e9f151a6cfd19a,6801,7050, 7 It is not in dispute that earlier this Court considered the bail application filed by the petitioner accused No 4 in Criminal Petition No 6790 2018 and subsequently in Criminal Petition No 9456 2018 dated 22 10 2018 and 11 2 2019 respectively ,ANALYSIS
d99fc38cbea846b9967a1da724c354cb,7051,7249,By considering the merits of the case this Court has came to the conclusion that there is prima facie material as against the petitioner accused and the bail applications were came to be dismissed ,ANALYSIS
8163e01c87184235bd16dce5ab874d15,7249,7387, 8 The only contention which has been raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner accused is that there is no progress in the case ,ANALYSIS
75156806386644f1a3f403446df386f6,7388,7603,Since more than two years the petitioner accused is in custody and his right and liberty is involved and it is the complainant who is the only witness and his evidence has to be testified during the course of trial ,ANALYSIS
d0102c2388824ea18bd7aea8f55ed020,7604,8167,But merely because the petitioner accused is in custody trial has not yet commenced is not a ground to release him on bail that too when the petitioner accused is involved in a serious offence of kidnapping and demanding money of Rs 10 Lakhs and already when the petitioner has approached this Court and it has considered the bail applications and has rejected the bail applications then under such circumstances I am of the considered opinion that it is not a fit case so as to reconsider the bail application and to enlarge the petitioner accused on bail ,ANALYSIS
359c577bfddd4bfda8cd6abf16bc92da,8167,8523,Though it is contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner accused that because of Covid 19 continuation of the petitioner accused in custody is not necessary in view of the direction of the Hon ble Apex Court in the said decision the Hon ble Apex Court issued direction to release the accused if the offences punishable are less than seven years ,ANALYSIS
0d344e47f02142fb8ddab2280e200e84,8524,8685,In that light the ratio laid down in the said case cannot be made applicable and the petitioner accused can be released on parole or released on a limited bail ,ANALYSIS
8b1864a4cc134f61a2e7ccb5c48dfcf7,8686,8769,Already it is notified that the Court should start function from 1st of June 2020 ,ANALYSIS
7a2c833920094e8d837a7ac27dfd6fa2,8770,8873,In that light if a direction is issued to expedite the trial it is going to meet the ends of justice ,ANALYSIS
1f085e65d07e4f45ac7c6c93b5b1c8d9,8873,9078, 9 Taking into consideration the above said facts and circumstances of the case I am of the considered opinion that the petitioner accused has not made out any good grounds so as to enlarge him on bail ,RATIO
586ecd45332840e48ff20f5c53690778,9079,9388,However I am of the considered opinion that if the learned Principal District and Sessions Judge Chikkamagaluru District is directed to expedite the trial expeditiously within a period of one year from the date of receipt of this order then under such circumstances it is going to meet the ends of justice ,RPC
8a94ed1891ae44f2b13524a399a6e927,9388,9443, With the above observation the petition is dismissed ,RPC
061f526690fd4b07adac11a6dfda51d2,9443,9576, However liberty has been given to the petitioner accused to move this Court for bail after examination of the complainant ,RPC

289dd154e2df4ef2ad0152bf34841888,8135,8583,It is curious how the two plaintiffs Bhupinder Singh of Gauhati and Ravi Raj Singh of Gaya who had obtained two identical de crees from Gauhati and Gaya courts against Petitioners 1 and 2 respectively simultaneously contacted the third respondent about the decrees obtained by them and how both of them made identical statements to third respondent that after executing the decrees they will give the shops to some other persons and get pagri ,ANALYSIS
72984c505e3b4134b341a88b25f22ad8,8584,8978,What is more curious is that the third respondent who claims to have become the owner of all the said four shops in the year 1992 itself having purchased them from Smt Urmila Devi did not protest against the third parties seeking to evict what according to him are his tenants from the premises owned by him and their proposal to lease them out to third parties and collect pagri themselves ,ANALYSIS

3d31026daeec46dd89d82add80f7b68d,9557,10012,It is abundantly clear that the said stratagem was resorted to by the third respondent with a view to obtain the surreptitious eviction of the 1st and 2nd petitioners in execution of the said spurious decrees since he may have thought that it would be difficult at any rate it will take a long time for him to obtain eviction of the said writ petitioners in a straight forward manner i e in accordance with the correct procedure prescribed by law ,ANALYSIS

e00d924af6ab49c9b6217970462c81ae,6020,6451,In Suma Das Vrs State of Orissa reported in 1993 II OLR 392 Hon ble Court has observed that Chemical test is the surest test for determining the illicit liquor Other tests are litmus and hydrometer test but can not be said to be surest unless prosecution establishes by evidence that the officer who made the test was specially skilled because his evidence is to be accepted as evidence of expert U s 45 of Indian Evidence Act ,PRE_RELIED
15a56c0185194494b857dc6288e2d7c2,6451,6591,Simple statement that the officer has been working in the department for a number of years would not attract Sec 45 of Indian Evidence Act ,PRE_RELIED
6968211c3a1c4ceeaf7e0d7cf80add58,6593,6757,In this case there is no evidence forth coming that the liquor was sent for chemical test which is the surest test to conclude the liquid is nothing but ID Liquor,ANALYSIS

2e651d095cd441b7959ed115294b28fc,6970,7061,Hence in view of the above fact that the liquid is nothing but liquor comes under cloud ,ANALYSIS
88c7b90050ec4a54ba686adb5d120613,7062,7202,Hence it can be safely concluded that prosecution has failed to prove that the liquid is noting but ID liquor beyond all reasonable doubts ,ANALYSIS
05915d82ed634e7fa5d357f726d135f1,7203,7526,8 Now coming to the second ingredient i e to establish the fact that the liquor was seized from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused person the prosecution has relied upon the testimonies of P W 1 P W 2 and P W 3 who deposed similarly regarding seizure of the liquor from the possession of the accused ,ANALYSIS

f3f95663daac42fba95fa17d9ab865f0,8228,8420,Hence the prosecution evidences on record in my opinion are not sufficient to establish the fact that the liquor has been seized from exclusive and conscious possession of the accused person ,ANALYSIS
6807889ec56a431d9b9d71f08a8587e7,8420,8673, Hence from the discussions above made I am of the view that prosecution has failed miserably to bring such direct and cogent evidences to establish the vital ingredients of offence U s 47 a of Bihar and Orissa Excise Act beyond all reasonable doubt ,RATIO

ce408b0fcba9417786d2ff8222a8ec1d,5242,5398, The question that arises in the present case is whether the statement of the approver has been corroborated in material particulars and qua the appellant ,ISSUE
43f2403dc9a946229f31a279599e20bc,5398,5780,The trial court convicted the appellant on the testimony of the approver and found corroboration for the approver s testimony in the statement of Nanu Sintu Sutar P W 7 who had prepared the knife alleged to have be been used for the offence on March 17 1960 and hi motive to commit the murder because of the suspicion he had about his wife having a liaison with the deceased ,RLC

6d54844df337416abd4af7819045d895,6278,6405,From those facts the learned Judges came to the conclusion that the approver Deoba was giving a true version of the occurrence ,ANALYSIS
64575221a3144be18bb133b6701d3ef0,6406,6673,With great respect to the High Court we are unable to agree because without corroboration of the approver qua the appellant the conviction is unsustainable the law being that there should be corroboration of the approver in material particulars and qua each accused ,ANALYSIS
1f517d31f68e4c9cac32a917dc492e48,6673,6757,The statement of Santu brother of the approver is no corroboration of the approver ,ANALYSIS
5b9368ebae71408f960d09cd56f99a52,6758,6831,it only means that approver made a confessional statement to his brother ,ANALYSIS
5e7ebb636437409a9541226ea93843fb,6832,6928,That cannot be called in the circumstances of this case to be a corroboration of the approver ,ANALYSIS
d662b1af4588408cbaa6529ab54cfd83,6929,7263,The evidence of Nanu Santu Sutar P W 7 also cannot operate as a corroboration of the approver s story because the knife was got prepared by accused No 1 and the appellant nine weeks before the murder and that fact by itself will not corroborate the charge under s 302 read with s 34 of the Indian Penal Code against the appellant ,ANALYSIS
30626ebbd97e4607a1f626ed7ca6214d,7264,7467,The time gap between the preparation of the knife and murder is great and it is possible in such circumstances that the appellant might have cemented and not proceeded with the commission of the offence ,ANALYSIS
7b8eca3da3ff475e87ce02e7e15bc7e8,7468,7684,The finding of the knife at the instance of the first accused also is no corroboration of the approver s story which would be sufficient to connect the appellant with the murder under s 34 of the Indian Penal Code ,ANALYSIS
4550724c91bb411eacac2ac0b46c05cb,7685,8060,It may be that in this case the approver s evidence was sufficiently corroborated for the conviction of the first accused upon which we express no opinion but so far as the appellant is concerned we find that there is no corroboration of the approver s story and it is not sufficient that there is evidence to corroborate the participation of the first accused in the murder ,ANALYSIS
4febb74cfdb74723afe36ea0345af4a1,8061,8208,It is also necessary for there being independent corroboration of the participation of the appellant in the offence with which he has been charged ,ANALYSIS

ac5ad75f181a4ac4a1edcb2565c01e19,8283,8598, In coming to the above conclusion we have not been unmindful of the provisions of s 133 of the Evidence Act which reads s 133 An accomplice shall be a competent witness against an accused person and a conviction is not illegal merely because it proceeds upon the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice ,STA
e76ecd31aa1e40be9ed70613612e4b07,8598,9034, It cannot be doubted that under that section a conviction based merely on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice may not be illegal the courts nevertheless cannot lose sight of the rule of prudence and practice which in the words of Martin B in Res v Boyes 1 has become so hallowed as to be deserving of respect and in the words of Lord Abinger it deserves to have all the reverence of the law ,PRE_RELIED
61cc3fda0e5a4faaaff7b0abaac6bb1e,9035,9256,This rule of guidance is to be found in illustration b to s 114 of the Evidence which is as follows The court may presume that an accomplice is unworthy of credit unless he is corroborated in material particulars ,STA

e1a21c0e21844b80a749320307dbcfd1,9822,10408,The danger of acting upon accomplice evidence is not merely that the accomplice is on his own admission a man of bad character who took part in the offence and afterwards to save himself betrayed his former associates and who has placed himself in a 1 1861 9 Cox Crim Cas 32 2 1949 L R 76 I A 147 3 I L R 1944 Mad 308 position in which he can hardly fail to have a strong bias in favour of the prosecution the real danger is that he is telling a story which in its general outline is true and it is easy for him to work into the story matter which is untrue ,PRE_RELIED

51276c236e3442fba52763ea5d92dcc4,2533,2794, 5 In order to substantiate its case prosecution has examined as many as three witnesses out of whom P W 1 is the SI of Excise P W 2 is the Excise staff who had accompanied P W 1 during the alleged patrolling duty and P W 3 is an independent seizure witness ,FAC
4dd5d09d23de4a658ef9b40342facdcc,2795,2891,On the other hand the defence has preferred not to examine any witness on behalf of the accused ,FAC

3fb0214926684ab0979400d842574345,3988,4136,appears from the evidence adduced that though the spot of seizure was a road but no independent corroboration is there to prove the fact of seizure ,FAC
b386b365e8d643299909a6b87aba0e3f,4137,4257,In the absence of independent corroboration to the evidence of the Excise personnel the prosecution case is suspicious ,FAC

63e35ab7534340739a38dd0bb99f449f,5611,5762,In absence of any chemical test so also any document to prove that the S I can be regarded as expert it is not safe to rely on the testimony of P W 1 ,ANALYSIS

0865c67f44f149febf161265c88443ff,7759,8034,The accused denied that he possessed any but the Excise officials searched the house and found in a secret chamber of an iron safe which was opened by the accused with the keys in his possession a bundle containing 28 gold biscuits and a half biscuit marked as M Os 1 29 ,FAC

8d9d7968682c4fb3825562573b0304c4,8177,8393,The accused was then questioned in the presence of the witnesses and he stated that he had been receiving gold biscuits from some unknown person from Bombay and that the other articles belonged to him and his mother ,FAC
20b6f8f580d040d882f63b077a301941,8394,8581,On being questioned further the accused admitted that he had no general or special permit from the Reserve Bank of India or the Gold Control Administrator to import or keep foreign gold ,FAC

8dd56815fbbf4301a74f925f641c7119,8647,8825,Before launching a prosecution the Collector of Central Excise issued a notice calling upon the appellant to show cause why M Os 1 to 51 be not confiscated and penalty levied ,FAC

e5668b6e6308461d9afae8024e926c10,9053,9186, Subsequently PW 5 the Assistant Collector of Customs filed a complaint for the prosecution of the appellant under the Customs Act ,FAC
d5a844395f544cba91d98192ff17c4ce,9187,9318,We have already mentioned that the prosecution and conviction under the Gold Control Act was set aside for lack of proper sanction ,FAC
ec6df68363d24667bbce34cbf8777811,9319,9534,It is also admitted by the prosecution in the instant case that as no seizure was made in accordance with the provisions of the Customs Act the presumption under s 123 thereof was not available to the prosecution ,FAC
7dcb018ca2134255834494ebbf068098,9534,10325, Section 135 1 b under which the appellant has been convicted runs thus 135 1 Without prejudice to any action that may be taken under this Act if any person b acquires possession of or is in any way concerned in carrying removing depositing harbouring keeping concealing selling or purchasing or in any other manner dealing with any goods which he knows or has reason to believe are liable to confiscation under section 111 Analysing the essential ingredients of clause b it is manifest that before a conviction can be recorded under it the prosecution must prove that the accused has acquired possession of or is in any way concerned in depositing keeping etc any goods which he knows or has reason to believe are liable to confiscation under s 111 ,STA
ccf2df2651ce4aca96f7e17a1bfe2bed,10326,10607,Thus in the instant case as no presumption under s 123 was available it was for the prosecution to prove affirmatively that the appellant was in possession of smuggled gold knowing full well that it was imported from outside the country so as to fall within the ambit of s 111 ,ANALYSIS
81aea8a880cf49c4b5e61011862fa62e,10608,10910,Dr Chitale appearing for the appellant contended that if the presumption under s 123 is not available to the prosecution then there is no legal evidence to show that the appellant had any knowledge or had any reason to believe that the goods were imported or were smuggled without a lawful permit ,ARG_PETITIONER
06f3bc48a0504fdcb9b56d0dd88b4c51,10911,11310,The counsel appearing for the State however submitted that the fact that the gold bore foreign markings and was recovered from the possession of the appellant who had admitted in his statement before the Customs officers that some unknown person had given it to him would itself raise a sufficient presumption to attribute knowledge to the appellant that the gold was smuggled without any permit ,ARG_RESPONDENT
1721b012fee24ff1bb1cf4b067e528e3,11311,11751,Although the question raised by the counsel for the parties is not free from difficulty an overall consideration of the special facts of the present case would show that there could no difficulty in holding that having regard to the admissionsmade by the appellant and his subsequent conduct the onus would shift to the appellant to show that the gold found from him with foreign markings was imported without any permit to his knowledge ,ANALYSIS
8031f791f30444a395302f03573ba60c,11752,11842,This will be the combined effect of the provisions of ss 106 and 114 of the Evidence Act ,ANALYSIS
2da67051686b4fd780b10627f643643b,11843,12073,The matter was considered at great length in the case of Berham Khurshed Pesikaka v The State of Bombay 1 where this Court holding that s 106 could not be construed to place the onus on the accused to prove the prosecution case,PRE_NOT_RELIED
113d4f2757b241e1b96d15410bd08dce,12073,12312, observed as follows Section 106 of the Evidence Act cannot be construed to mean that the accused has by reason of the circumstance that the facts are especially within his own knowledge to prove that he has not committed the offence ,PRE_NOT_RELIED

7b93a067df824c14872055d44b66feaa,12427,12590,It is for the prosecution to prove that he has committed the offence and that burden is not in any manner whatsoever displaced by section 106 of the Evidence Act ,PRE_NOT_RELIED
5b5c8ac587424ae3afb81627099925f5,12590,12668, These observations were made with respect to the peculiar facts of that case ,ANALYSIS
42c959a1923e489685d60ca670f9bb5b,12669,12879,It appears that what had happened in that case was that the appellant was found to be guilty of an offence under the Prohibition Act and the only evidence to prove his guilt was that he was smelling of alcohol ,ANALYSIS
1eb9d934261a4dff9e0289fdebe22a02,12880,13331,This Court held that it was for the prosecution to prove the contravention of the provisions of the Prohibition Act and to prove further that a particular intoxicant which was a liquor under the Act was consumed by the accused and merely because the accused knew what he had taken which was a matter within his knowledge could not relieve the prosecution of the burden of proving that the liquor consumed was an intoxicant as defined under the Act ,ANALYSIS
00b4eb6ae432407db7350f64a53cc01a,13332,13505,It is therefore clear that the observations made by this Court regarding the interpretation of s 106 of the Evidence Act would not apply to the facts of the present case ,ANALYSIS
a1b0a62c17a34d31a8fc74d7badb8de1,13506,13740,In the case of Issardas Daulat Ram Ors v The Union of India Ors 2 this Court after discussing the admitted circumstances of the case found that the relevant pieces of evidence would prove the guilty knowledge of the accused ,PRE_RELIED
95181ae0d2a1422d8ab58b7df077ea40,13740,14081, That was a case which arose under s 178 A of the Sea Customs Act and this Court observed as follows If the gold now in question had been imported earlier it would be extremely improbable that the gold would remain in the same shape of bars and with the same fineness as when imported after the passage of this length of time ,PRE_RELIED
9a911cd937af4a59b3c7b414b2101f27,14082,14431,It was precisely for this reason that at the stage of the enquiry before the Collector the principal point which was urged on behalf of the appellants was to deny that the seized gold was of foreign origin and it is the nature of the defence that accounts for the order of the Collector dealing almost wholly with the consideration of that question ,PRE_RELIED
085493a380ec4f588738bdf671ad01f7,14432,14559,In order to reach his finding about the gold being smuggled the Collector has referred to the conduct of the appellants ,PRE_RELIED

df08eaa06b6d4a7b95b5807cc1e16429,14913,15025,The facts of the present case appear to us to be almost on all fours with the facts of the case mentioned above ,ANALYSIS
5acb24bead844d98ba1047a33f8d6e6c,15025,15189, Here also the facts are that gold with foreign marking in the shape of biscuits without indicating any change was recovered from the possession of the appellant ,ANALYSIS
06f90b97db6740fb8e735e9ed598547c,15190,15274,Secondly the appellant admitted that the gold was brought from outside the country ,ANALYSIS
0b55e0ed5d06494f846be34cb113f544,15275,15446,The appellant further admitted that he did not hold any permit for importing the gold and the plea taken by him was that some unknown person had delivered the gold to him ,ANALYSIS
be82543f13b3424590ef42f1bc8f52d0,15447,15887,In view of these circumstances and the fact as to how the accused came into possession of the gold and whether it was imported or not being within the special knowledge of the accused if he failed to disclose the identity of the person who gave him the gold then it was open to the Court to presume under ss 106 and 114 of the Evidence Act that the appellant knew that the gold in his possession was smuggled and imported without permit ,ANALYSIS
012d433c733d4e848c335f5b5048739d,15889,16341,In The State of Punjab v Gian Chand Ors Criminal Appeal No 195 of 1962 disposed of on 2 4 1968 while examining the validity of conviction and sentence under s 167 81 of the Sea Customs Act 1878 this Court held that as the accused did not claim any ownership over the gold and was a bullion merchant the mere fact that the gold had foreign markings would not be sufficient to prove that the accused had knowledge that the gold was smuggled ,PRE_RELIED
0391cdd3b1fb43fd807df2fa1923feb5,16342,16695,In this connection this Court observed as follows In our view the High Court was right in its conclusion because the fact that none of the respondents claimed ownership over the said gold could not necessarily mean either that the gold was smuggled gold or that the respondents were in possession thereof with the knowledge that it was so ,PRE_RELIED
4ced8d26bbe64679a3344d79cf62f82e,16696,16791,The fact that the gold has foreign marks stamped on it can only mean that the gold was foreign ,PRE_RELIED
adde36f3b4f540eaa11817d3c6ca3654,16792,16962,But since such foreign gold used to be imported before the present restrictions were imposed on its importation it could have been imported without any violation of law ,PRE_RELIED
ba43070bb0c441d299a3215244c55ea0,16963,17058,Consequently that fact alone would not establish either of the two ingredients of s 167 81 ,PRE_RELIED

8ff1f884ca354087871fb4aea0881ee8,17161,17369,In the first place in the case mentioned above the accused was a bullion merchant and it was in the very nature of circumstances and as a part of his profession natural for him to be in possession of gold ,ANALYSIS
7acb696b3bdd40209d18c8e739a3acf1,17370,17684,Secondly the Court clearly held that during those days foreign gold used to be freely imported in our country and therefore the mere presence of foreign markings would not be sufficient to raise a presumption under s 106 of the Evidence Act so as to attribute knowledge to the accused that the gold was smuggled ,ANALYSIS
05498a0da9cb4fdbb89025100c287d93,17685,17796,In the instant case the facts are quite different and so is the nature of the admission made by the appellant ,ANALYSIS
3777707a7fce4b9fbe2bddddafd0d308,17806,18210,In a later decision of this Court in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax Madras v Messrs Best Co 1 this Court observed as follows When sufficient evidence either direct or circumstantial in respect of its contention was disclosed by the Revenue adverse inference could be drawn against the assessee if he failed to put before the Department material which was in his exclusive possession ,PRE_RELIED
fc1a859551474209a28c24b169bfffa6,18211,18342,The process is described in the law of evidence as shifting of the onus in the course of a proceeding from one party to the other ,PRE_RELIED
9dd0c23ffda44b27afe3b6a8200e2d64,18342,18509, It is true that case arose under the provisions of the income Tax Act but the principles laid down by this Court would apply equally to the facts of the present case ,ANALYSIS
1e51895b4a0a4e0b9aabfa636f51468b,18510,18929,In the case of Collector of Customs Madras Ors v D Bhoormull 2 a case under the Customs Act while dwelling on the nature and purport of the onus which lay on the prosecution this Court observed as follows It cannot be disputed that in proceeding for imposing penalties under clause 8 of s 167 to which s 178 A does not apply the burden of proving that the goods are smuggled goods is on the Department ,PRE_RELIED
aa5a215fbe7744a7a92b2cb004291c49,18930,19085,This is a fundamental rule relating to proof in all criminal or quasi criminal proceedings where there is no statutory provision to the contrary ,PRE_RELIED
b4cfbce752e9456ea28a2388d4f9cdcd,19086,19253,But in appreciating its scope and the nature of the onus cost by it we must pay due regard to other kindred principles no less fundamental of universal application ,PRE_RELIED
7121893681bf41e9ae3b49a953092bbf,19254,19402,One of them is that the prosecution or the Department is not required to prove its case with mathematical precision to a demonstrable degree ,PRE_RELIED
0ceca4d971f84d7da5e5be4de36bb9e5,19403,19562, All that it requires is the establishment of such a degree of probability that a prudent man may on its basis believe in the existence of the fact in issue ,PRE_RELIED
cc6a56e19d6e4fa0812df041b04af182,19563,19707,Thus legal proof is not necessarily perfect proof often it is nothing more than a prudent man s estimate as to the probabilities of the case ,PRE_RELIED

16a3fe8546e04f5b896ba628077fca06,20027,20171,The Collector had given the fullest opportunity to Bhoormull to establish the alleged acquisition of the goods in the normal course of business ,PRE_RELIED

9c61b33d4fd8425ebc694617a8b91836,20279,20539,He was simply giving him a fair opportunity of rebutting the first and the foremost presumption that arose out of the tell tale circumstances in which the goods were found regarding their being smuggled goods by disclosing facts within his special knowledge ,PRE_RELIED
7f7649250f42488b8cde83d28cdffdf7,20539,20892, It was also pointed out that the broad effect of the application of the basic principles underlying s 106 of the Evidence Act would be that onus is discharged if the prosecution adduces only so much evidence circumstantial or direct as is sufficient to raise a presumption in its favour with regard to the existence of the facts sought to be proved ,ANALYSIS

820f9b27766b4fc88bea7355a8a9bbbc,22669,22790,It was held therein that having regard to the conduct of the accused and nature of the articles mens rea was established ,PRE_RELIED
297a14f59393471f8ab507d634ce0966,22791,23029,In this connection this Court observed as follows The very appearance of the goods and the manner in which they were packed indicated that they were newly manufactured and brought into this country very recently from another country ,PRE_RELIED
c03264e629f54b1a89dbf434fe9463ba,23030,23223,The inscriptions on them and writing on the boxes were parts of the state in which the goods in unopened boxes were found from which inferences about their origin and recent import could arise ,PRE_RELIED
591e661946d1446aa39b5e01894395fc,23224,23367,The appellant s conduct including his untruthful denial of their possession indicated consciousness of their smuggled character or mens rea ,PRE_RELIED
b50237c334374dd0ad7a5fbfca66563b,23369,23666,From the aforesaid case also it would appear that this Court was prepared to draw a presumption against the accused from the fact that the articles concerned were concealed and had particular markings and special features and from the nature of the unsatisfactory explanation given by the accused ,ANALYSIS
ea06e72298524cffb6ca06fab266418f,23666,23915, While it is therefore true that in the instant case the seizure was not made under s 111 of the Customs Act and the prosecution could not press into service the presumption arising from s 123 of the Customs Act that does not clinch the issue ,ANALYSIS
5a6ec060b7414c5c8a8f38030eb8c7a5,23916,24252,It is proved that the appellant was in possession of gold with foreign markings which was found to be in the shape of biscuits or bars kept in a secret chamber of the safe and that the accused admitted that the gold was brought from outside the country and was given to him by somebody whose identity he was not prepared to disclose ,RATIO
042127ab2ad143eeb54c7b8324a11e45,24252,24612,Thus the appellant knew as to who was the person who had given him the gold and if he also knew as he says that the gold was smuggled he must have known whether the person who delivered the gold to him brought it under a permit or without any permit because at the time of the occurrence the import of gold was banned excepting under special circumstances ,RATIO
8dbbd7b9495048f8bfcc544f8e05129a,24613,24821,Having regard to the totality of the situation there is no reason why the prosecution would not be entitled to call into aid the combined effect of the presumptions under ss 106 and 114 of the Evidence Act ,RATIO
59fb58ba34d645ee918b60784ae19cd9,24822,24946,We are therefore satisfied that the prosecution has clearly proved the charge under s 135 1 b ii of the Customs Act ,RATIO
33b1789b2ccf46e6a55d7f6217bc66f1,24946,25093, It was also contended by Dr Chitale that as the case had been going on for eight years a lenient view on the question of sentence may be taken ,RATIO
19f22717f820432fb9ae1c6590984c2b,25094,25216,The sentence being one only of rigorous imprisonment for nine months we think there is no room for any reduction thereof ,RATIO
580b576a89c14e6e8b707f7bde263264,25216,25293, For the reasons given above the appeal fails and is accordingly dismissed ,RPC

277403e21b734005bb11eee3ab2a199b,3992,4325, 6 Looking to the facts and circumstances of the case the Trial Court has observed that in the absence of any material to show the income of the husband it is quite natural to hold that atleast the wife requires Rs 4 000 per month for the purpose of day to day expenditure for maintenance and also for clothing medicines etc ,RLC
4298d77bb9c94ddbb56850b39eda1882,4326,4382,Therefore the Trial Court awarded Rs 4 000 per month ,RLC
19a168405dce48c89dafa80652dd68c0,4383,4536,The husband has taken up a very casual defence that he is ready and willing to take her back but it appears he has not made any efforts in this regard ,ANALYSIS

0ab3e2d1840c424ab3f6a8cf8cdea213,5384,5537,8 In the above said circumstances awarding of maintenance at the rate of Rs 4 000 per month in my opinion cannot be called as an exorbitant amount ,ANALYSIS
5003e2e4cf9f427ba8e6000c2615d6e7,5538,5754,However it is made it clear that if the husband or the wife would get any amount more in the changed circumstances they can approach once again the Trial Court either for enhancement or for reduction of the amount ,ANALYSIS

30a055622ae6467dad15cb557996e068,5040,5196,In view of the above discussion the fact that the seized article was recovered from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused becomes doubtful ,ANALYSIS
c317215ecb734463a908aaf136ea1153,5197,5371,Hence it is concluded that prosecution has failed to prove the factum of seizure from the exclusive and conscious possession of the accused beyond all the reasonable doubts ,ANALYSIS

e1350c3965534f8a858b5195b83c754f,5712,6443, learned APP strenuously argued that as per Sec 53 of Odisha Excise act 2008 in case of an offence u s 52 of the Act if it is established by chemical analysis or by adducing evidence of trained Excise Officer or otherwise that the seized liquid materials or other things are a intoxicant or b still utensils implement or apparatus whatsoever for the manufacture of any intoxicant other than tari or c any material which has undergone any process towards the manufacture of any intoxicant or from which an intoxicant has been manufactured the Court shall presume that the seized liquid or materials or other things are recovered from the conscious possession of the accused unless and until the contrary is proved ,ANALYSIS
986e476d6dc84d548882381dd6f951bb,6444,6922,The learned APP argued that as the SI of Excise has done the tests required to ascertain the nature of liquor and as from such tests and from his departmental experience and distillery training he has opined the same to be nothing but ID liquor as per the presumption provided u s 53 of the Odisha Excise Act it shall be presumed that the contraband was seized from the conscious possession of the accused and hence the accused is liable to be held guilty ,ARG_PETITIONER
b78f84a85f124bf4ba14ebd86a2bf617,6922,6994,Law is well settled that chemical test is the surest test of I D liquor ,ANALYSIS
ea6aa567f0d6418bb71f12a86f99eed9,6995,7321,Where chemical test has not been done and other tests like blue litmus paper and hydrometer test etc has been done the burden lies on the prosecution to establish that the officer is specially trained and has long departmental experience so that his evidence can be accepted as expert opinion and can substitute chemical test ,ANALYSIS
e17493357a844aba97e8030b593261bf,7322,7633,In this context it is pertinent to reflect the Explanation appended to Sec 53 of the Odisha Excise Act 2008 which provides as follows Explanation Trained Excise Officer shall mean an officer who has under gone distillery training and obtained a certificate from the concerned Superintendent of Excise ,STA
8428297192e442218301be1e26af88bf,7633,7755, But in the instant case there is nothing in the evidence of P W 2 to reveal that he had under gone distillery training ,ANALYSIS

acb1bbab4cf2420382017917934211df,7889,8040,In absence of any chemical test so also any document to prove that the S I can be regarded as expert it is not safe to rely on the testimony of P W 2 ,ANALYSIS

9ec7b6e3133b4eee9aba79201aa82426,5280,5491,There is no doubt that the assessment orders under section 143 3 were passed in these years under which total income was determined under normal provisions and book provisions of section 115JB were not invoked ,RLC
6a98cc7f8af345c7a1560f251a5a1c06,5492,5710,The issues which are considered in normal assessment are still pending before the ITAT for adjudication whereas the Assessing Officer under the guise of section 154 disallowed certain amounts revising the book profits ,RLC

cbb13d6f332a41c6aeb678a22542946d,6193,6426, In that view the entire exercises of modifying the orders is redundant as even after such adjustment the tax determined under the normal provisions is more than the tax that are being determined by this order under section 154 8 ,RLC
3841a21dd4244103bfec1ef6ce3daac0,6427,6632,Be that as it may just because a retrospective amendment has been carried out on the statue the assessment cannot be modified without examining whether the provisions so made are to be disallowed or not ,RLC
788056e46d414b8789bc2e2bd96a9a6b,6633,6855,This requires detailed examination and in fact as for the submissions made before the authorities the assessee had appeared before the Assessing Officer furnishing various details and how the amounts cannot be disallowed ,RLC
aa046286b6404d49a934f7206930702c,6856,7020,Since this requires claborate examination on a long run process we are of the opinion that the orders cannot be modified by invoking the provisions of section 154 ,RLC

c0439fa1833140a4988fb07bc056a0c7,7192,7335,In view of this we hold that the order under section 154 passed by the Assessing Officer is not correct and therefore the same was set aside ,RLC

1c87c97367f641a89524d2852d398b44,7518,7656,Relying upon the date stamp everybody took it for granted that limitation would expire on the 60th day counting time from July 16 1957 ,FAC

fc63786979ae483da00282f421285b4a,10071,10287,The receipt of the notice on July 15 is admitted but the affixing of the date stamp on the 16th was due to the failure of theclerk to deal with the notice on the 15th because he fell ill and had to leave the office ,ANALYSIS
1732598894484ce1a3103dd46a9024fa,10288,10415,It is common knowledge that date stamps are altered every day in the office and this is done mostly by a very junior employee ,ANALYSIS
9f02cbe1fbb94f578a22ff17ccba8916,10416,10629,The affixing of the date stamp on the 16th and the notice consequently bearing that date went unnoticed and relying upon the date stamp the appeal was filed though on the last day of limitation but within time ,ANALYSIS
0e014f13f4c049bfa51b2631e48ed05e,10630,10898,In these circumstances it is difficult to say that the Commissioner of Income tax was negligent and the negligence if any on the part of the clerk in affixing a wrong date stamp is excusable if one considers his illness and his absence from the office on the 15th ,ANALYSIS

e11884484b8f4b09ad182ad8c2195bdd,21235,21382,But it has been held over and over again that the question is not one of pure fact and that a mixed question of fact and law is always involved ,ANALYSIS
8adabc50c4d7408aa943c2ab6eb59881,21383,21563,The cases to which we shall make a reference presently have laid down this proposition and those cases have also indicated how the matter is to be viewed in the context of facts ,ANALYSIS
823e40ca0e274dc8adca1f5d2c334630,21564,21739,In Commissioner of Income tax v Ramnarain Sons Ltd 1 the Company was a dealer in sharesand also carried on the business of acquiring managing agencies of other Companies ,ANALYSIS

ecb9221afa894e82a58ab303b70604a7,22163,22345,This was shown in the books of the Company as a busines loss but was disallowed as the shares were not held to be the stock in trade of the business of the Company as share dealers ,ANALYSIS
6c86fd8da22249c182aa94f4766a1625,22346,22441,On a reference to the High Court of Bombay a Divisional Bench upheld the view of the Tribunal ,ANALYSIS
547202ffe66046bbb90742937c53b12b,22442,22668,Chagla C J in delivering the judgment of the Court observed that a managing agency being an asset of an enduring nature the way to look at the matter was to enquire what was the primary intention in acquiring the shares ,ANALYSIS
c510f6abe77c41a29985fcb11fcdb345,22669,23215,The learned Chief Justice then referred to a judgment of this Court reported in Kishan Prasad Co Ltd v Commissioner of Income tax 1 where it was observed It seems that the object of the assessee Company in buying shares was purely to obtain the managing agency of the third mill which no doubt would have been an asset of an enduring nature and would have brought them profits but there was from the inception no intention whatever on the part of the assessee Company to re sell the shares either at a profit or otherwise deal in them ,ANALYSIS
19d0166804a04584a86b90159084fb36,23216,23573,The learned Chief Justice then considered the argument that a block of shares might have to be bought if at all at a higher price and observed as follows A dealer in shares may succeed in getting a large number of shares at a price less than the market price if the seller is in difficulties and wants to get rid of his shares and to get liquid assets ,ANALYSIS
0dfb0fc45b3745469dd9bf7caf804d56,23574,23694,But we have not heard of a dealer in shares purchasing a large number of shares at a higher value than the market value ,ANALYSIS
97fc48670d8c4229b6baab9346b571b5,23695,23832,The other circumstance which is equally strong in this case is that the shares were purchased for the acquisition of the managing agency ,ANALYSIS
2a2e9c701bf94f20b3ca25c3992709de,23833,24065,Therefore the real object of the assessee company was not to do business in these shares not to make profit out of these shares but to acquire a capital asset out of which it would earn managing agency commission and make profit ,ANALYSIS
e4fca3a3552b494681be274a573a7523,24065,24181, Messrs Ramnarain and Sons Ltd then appealed to this Court and the decision of the Bombay High Court was upheld ,ANALYSIS
b6ec8a87bced4ac9b301492a1f103310,24182,24284,The Judgment of this Court is reported in Ramnarain Sons Pr Ltd v Commissioner of Income tax 1 ,ANALYSIS
9c662b7f598748b2a54f00a3c7a7bb9c,24285,24590,It was laid down by this Court that in considering whether a transaction was or was not an adventure in the nature of trade the problem must be approached in the light of the intention of the assessee having regard to the legal requirements which are associated with the concept of trade or business ,ANALYSIS
b35e790d48f34f858cb256f044b96ad4,24590,24983,Dealing with the price above the market price which was paid in that case it was observed Even assuming that the appellants acquired the entire block of 2 507 shares from M s Sassoon J David Co Ltd the shares transferred to the names of the directors being held by them merely as nominees of the appellants the price per share was considerably in excess of the prevailing market rate ,ANALYSIS
67117f93b7b94e7cb9f9eef91c8ecbb0,24984,25159,The only reason for entering into the transaction which could not otherwise be regarded as a prudent business transaction was the acquisition of the managing agency ,ANALYSIS
8e8e655c10824198aefc9a53ed34c5ef,25160,25482,If the purpose of the acquisition of a large block of shares at a price which exceeded the current market price by a million rupees was the acquisition of the managing agency the inference is inevitable that the intention in purchasing the shares was not to acquire them as part of the trade of the appellants in shares ,ANALYSIS
e9fc78e75f544c70b92e1f1cd6073e7a,25482,25621, The above two decisions are merely the application of a principle of long standing which has been stated over and over again in the past ,ANALYSIS
02eab0ace20344d099c6a6b5e9b4444b,25622,25970,In Oriental Investment Co Ltd v Commissioner of Income tax 1 that principle was reiterated and it was that the object for which a company was formed did not invest the deal with the characteristics of a trade in shares but that other circumstances along with that fact must be considered to find out the real object of a particular venture ,ANALYSIS
e87b8298d8324d4ea248454fcb2214d6,25970,26062, Before we deal with the present case one other case of this Court may be noticed ,ANALYSIS
47043430739f498d91495bd01795ee60,26063,26156,In Rajputana Textiles v Commissioner of Income tax 2 the converse conclusion was reached ,PRE_RELIED
a560794e13ce424fab589ba455b2df27,26157,26344,There on the facts and circumstances of the case it was held that a particular deal in shares was a commercial venture and had all the attributes of an adventure in the nature of trade ,PRE_RELIED
571b1d4b555b4add875d931565563ba9,26345,26554,In that case the transaction was not a single or an undivided one with a slump payment because for the managing agency Rs 12 50 000 were paid separately and for the shares a sum of Rs 83 98 000 was paid ,ANALYSIS
9a8a1e3875d141ae9f3904a97eab3e4c,26555,26686,The two acquisitions being different the profit on the sale of some of the shares was considered to be a gain on the revenue side ,ANALYSIS
9b810f45ef8845179f0f7b822c3570ba,26686,26829, There is no doubt whatever that the shares of the Madhusudan Mills Ltd were acquired at a price considerably higher than the market price ,ANALYSIS
3c42136d1b9f4786a970376440e2cae6,26829,26877, In fact that the price paid was almost double ,ANALYSIS
829f9529abfb4ed5b0a257861bf27067,26877,26993, Such a deal from the business point of view was not prudent unless the purchaser stood to gain in someother way ,ANALYSIS
89d831fe88544e8dadc81492b72d3e90,26994,27150,It was contended before us that this was a speculative deal in the hope that the price of the shares would firm up when the textile industries would revive ,ANALYSIS
4157147405ca443ba8cbb3efbd6d9c0a,27151,27311,If this was the intention then it might possibly be argued that the purchasers miscarried in their calculations and suffered a loss in a business transaction ,ANALYSIS
94703c49bc464e14a73aa272c31e21d3,27311,27386, But was this the intention of the Directors of Jaswant Sugar Mills Ltd ,ANALYSIS
9f184148b4a0424b866df1bde93540bf,27387,27716,Those who sold the shares were not only in possession of the shares but also of the managing agency of the Madhusudan Mills Ltd and the intention of the Directors of Jaswant Sugar Mills Ltd was to remove the sellers from their position as managing agents and to get the entire benefit of such or other agencies for themselves ,ANALYSIS
3d6c269cb1a54cd1910fd94586f0e36a,27717,27919,The assessee Company has urged that might have been the intention of they Jaswant Sugar Mills Ltd but not of the assessee Company which had on that day merely given a loan to Jaswant Sugar Mills Ltd ,ANALYSIS
d92e50291afc45dbb3c68b59b2d7f4c4,27920,28297,Curiously enough however the immediate benefit of the deal was the acquisition of the selling and purchasing agency of the Mills and that was obtained not in favour of Jaswant Sugar Mills Ltd but of the assessee Company even though on July 15 1948 the date of purchase the assessee Company had obtained registration of 10 5000 shares by way of security in its own name ,ANALYSIS
5250aa8985e54be4911b221eabcf3377,28298,28367,Why the assessee Company was favoured in this way is not far to seek ,ANALYSIS
e072915d01904249bd735994d662ea54,28368,28517,It mattered not whether Jaswant Sugar Mills Ltd acquired that agency or the assessee Company the benefit thereof went to the same group of persons ,ANALYSIS
feb9429acf8a43cca7141b289ddfac24,28518,28791,The transaction of sale of the shares was also made within three months of their purchase and the assessee Company not only bought the 10 500 shares which stood in its name but 15 547 shares which gave the assessee Company a controlling voice in the affairs of the Mills ,ANALYSIS
10c65de063074fce94309d80db305dab,28792,28894,The assessee Company continued to retain the selling and purchasing agency which was very profitable ,ANALYSIS
905c6c4da1914d4cb34586d61a962075,28894,28958, Indeed on its investment in the first year of Rs 14 lakhs odd,ANALYSIS
acde7dbc81bf43a3a63ad80bbbc52cf3,28958,28997, itmade a profit of about Rs 7 lakhs ,ANALYSIS
acb563f852d04925b8ae98a8a01ef5fb,28998,29192,The question therefore would be whether the assessee company in purchasing the shares merely wished to deal in shares as stock in trade or was acquiring a capital asset of an enduring nature ,ANALYSIS
439032c460464291b2f517b273253fd5,29193,29317,This question is not one of fact pure and simple hut one of an inference in law from the proved circumstances of the case ,ANALYSIS
50fcc263d56949bb841153d8e68f72e3,29317,29602, The Income tax Officer in deciding this question against the assessee Company pointed out numerous circumstances which showed clearly that this was not a mere purchase of shares as shares by a speculator who buying a big block sometimes pays slightly more than the market rate ,ANALYSIS
ed93d043618b4a00a5fe2164e42b4dcc,29603,29782,Bhadani Brothers Ltd owned not only the shares but also the managing agency and it is obvious that they would not part with the shares without charging for the managing agency ,ANALYSIS

ff4d2aa3495d4d619b852ee84bf98768,17310,17717,It was argued that as the suggested alteration was considered just a minor internal arrangement it was likely that the Chairman thought that no prior approval of the Central Government was necessary before the altered arrangement was put into operation in which case the notices would be invalid in view of Rule 4 of the Central Board of Direct Taxes Regulation of Transaction of Business Rules 1964 ,ARG_RESPONDENT

e8ea4023721b4831b29a1f36d8bf5d6c,3030,3721, 4 However the learned Counsel for the petitioner would place reliance on a decision of this court in the case of L R Naidu vs State of Karnataka 1984 Cri LJ 475 where in a similar situation this court relying on the decisions in B R Sinha vs State 1982 Cri LJ 61 Pritam Singh vs State of Punjab 1981 Cr LJ NOC 59 and Gurubaksh Singh vs State of Punjab AIR 1980 SC 1632 has pointed out that it would not be impermissible for a court of one State to grant anticipatory bail if the petitioner resides within its jurisdiction in respect of apprehended arrest in a case pending in some other State without the jurisdiction of the court and seeks to place reliance on the same ,ARG_PETITIONER
5c32a3c17b8b4da092cb518a79bfcfb6,3721,4222, It is to be seen that the Supreme Court while dealing with a prayer for anticipatory bail in Gurubaksh Singh supra has held as follows In regard to anticipatory bail if the proposed accusation appears to stem not from motives of furthering the ends of justice but from some ulterior motive the object being to injure and humiliate the applicant by having him arrested a direction for the release of the applicant on bail in the event of his arrest would generally be made ,PRE_RELIED
3ed2c702ed9047d287896c470db2a073,4222,4424,On the other hand if it appears likely considering the antecedents of the applicant that taking advantage of the order of anticipatory bail he will flee from justice such an order would not be made ,PRE_RELIED

420b9fabcabe4514b1178d2c92c97a99,4489,4765,That is to say it cannot be laid down as an inexorable rule that anticipatory bail cannot be granted unless the proposed accusation appears to be actuated by mala fides and equally that anticipatory bail must be granted if there is no fear that the applicant will abscond ,PRE_RELIED
8eff0e20ba9840388939ac63079fcf7d,4766,4934,There are several other considerations too numerous to enumerate the combined effect of which must weigh with the court while granting or rejecting anticipatory bail ,PRE_RELIED
d37d5e2ff50c4068894abc68c0459bcb,4935,5380,The nature and seriousness of the proposed charges the context of the events likely to lead to the making of the charges a reasonable possibility of the applicant s presence not being secured at the trial reasonable apprehension that witnesses will be tampered with and the larger interests of the public or the State are some of the considerations which the court has to keep in mind while deciding an application for anticipatory bail ,PRE_RELIED
abba6c3457844de98a112309d5eeb937,5380,5790,And the Calcutta High Court has held as follows in identical circumstances as arising in the case on hand Considering the provisions laid down in S 438 of the Code and the principles of law with regard to anticipatory bail explained by their Lordship in Gurubaksh Singh s case 1982 Cr L J 1125 S C and also considering the view taken by atleast three Division Benches to the case referred to above,PRE_RELIED
5db95dc21bd14723b5caeff81edb3511,5790,6079, we are of the opinion that this Court has jurisdiction to entertain application for anticipatory bail of a petitioner who resides within the jurisdiction of the Court though he apprehends arrest in connection with a case which has been started outside the jurisdiction of this Court ,PRE_RELIED
8edf0e2d7f4844e7bd9929329b27aacf,6079,6181,And therefore the petitioner has made out a case for grant of anticipatory bail for a limited period ,RATIO

f554fc48b69d4aaca4463129bc0637c4,6408,6564, The appeal lies within a very narrow compass and turns upon the interpretation of the order passed by the appellate authority under section 128 of the Act ,FAC

39eba66a679e442789ac5e3569c3eca4,13044,13445,The term without prejudice has been defined in Black s Law Dictionary as follows Where an offer or admission is made without prejudice or a motion is denied or a bill in equity dismissed without prejudice it is meant as a declaration that no rights or privileges of the party concerned are to be considered as thereby waived or lost except in so far as may be expressly conceded or decided ,ANALYSIS

6cb181cdf30d45ef90f59af15528dbe4,13487,13903, Similarly in Wharton s Law Lexicon the author while interpreting the term without prejudice observed as follows The words import an understanding that if the negotiation fails nothing that has passed shall be taken advantage of thereafter so if a defendant offer without prejudice to pay half the claim the plaintiff must not only rely on the offer as an admission of his having a right to some payment ,ANALYSIS
9171d4e4e46a416995a5182759605fdc,13929,14177, The rule is that nothing written or said without prejudice can be considered at the trial without the consent of both parties not even by a judge in determining whether or not there is good cause for depriving a successful litigant of costs ,ANALYSIS

1a1a5878b52c4dd5899570d98799156c,19060,19242,For these reasons therefore the Gujarat case is clearly distinguishable because the order in that case was couched in terms very different from the one we have in the instant case ,ANALYSIS
52b8bd1f1ef24e1c90005d0eba6948da,19243,19675,Thus on a careful consideration of the facts and circumstances of the present case we are clearly of the opinion that where an order passed in appeal vacates the order of the first tribunal on purely technical grounds and expressly states that it was being passed without prejudice which means an order not on the merits of the case such as order does not debar fresh adjudicatory proceedings which may be justified under the law ,RATIO
256e561b01894a6c835dc5a59e8d0a33,19676,19944,It is necessary for the court interpreting an order of this kind to give full and complete effect to the exact words used by the authorities and not to draw a sweeping conclusion merely from the fact that no explicit direction has been made by the appellate authority ,RATIO
7de0bf5e05e0459d816ab809dda9000d,19945,20205,We are unable to agree in this case with the High Court that as no express words were used in the order of the Appellate Collector remanding the case the Assistant Collector was not justified in commencing fresh adjudicatory proceedings against the respondent ,RATIO
6054549f9dc943b795be06081decb1ac,20205,20490, For these reasons therefore we allow the appeal set aside the order of the High Court and dismiss the writ petition filed by the respondent in the High Court and restore the fresh adjudicatory proceedings started by the Assistant Collector by virtue of the notice dated 27 7 1972 ,RPC
0365f94f81cd4e1f8db822b3bf11b507,20491,20563,In the peculiar circumstances of this case we make no order as to costs ,RPC

d2b347c0f36d4820adb464ab75e9c4d2,5372,5876,As rightly contended by him Sec 194A 3 i b of the Act is a provision which mandates deduction of tax at source by a co operative Society carrying on the business of banking where the income in the form of interest which is paid by such society is in excess of ten thousand rupees Sec 194A 3 v of the Act provides that tax need not be deducted at source where the income in the form of interest is credited or paid by a co operative society to a member thereof or to any other co operative society ,ANALYSIS
8fce8b1fc3c84ef49e3dd68da1609e6c,5877,6006,This provision therefore applies to all co operative societies including co operative society engaged in the business of banking ,ANALYSIS
402e5b40d7f34d6981800a6daa7caeb6,6007,6444,It is not possible to exclude co operative society engaged in the business of banking from the provisions of sec 194A 3 v of the Act on the ground that the same is covered by the provisions of sec 194A 3 i b of the Act Sec 194A 3 v of the Act refers to payment by a co operative society to a member and payment by a co operative society to non member continue to be governed by the provisions of Sec 194A 3 i b of the Act ,STA

0b3a6d3b896540e487def918e7bfe12f,6981,7334,We do not agree with the view expressed by the Pune ITAT SMC in the case of Bhagani Nivedita Sahakari Bank Ltd supra when it says that co operative society as mentioned in CL v is a general species whereas the other five categories of co operative societies which are specifically referred to in other provisions are specific co operative societies ,PRE_NOT_RELIED

76e043327d8940fc8cbc40496735356c,8275,8899,He contended firstly that the Provincial Legislature had authority under Entry 48 of List 11 Sch VII of the Government of India Act 1935 to impose tax only on sale of goods that the supply of materials in works contracts was not a sale within that Entry and that the provisions of the Act which sought to impose a tax thereon treating it as a sale were therefore ultra vires and secondly that he was entitled to exemption under item 33 in Sch 11 to the Act as enacted by Act XVI of 1949 and that the notification of the Government dated September 18 1950 withdrawing that exemption was unconstitutional and void,ARG_PETITIONER

e4fbbcf67bb847deab9ede98ff23d63a,10128,10333,The resultant position is that the appellant who was entitled to exemption under Act XVI of 1949 in respect of goods sold to the Government could no longer claim it by reason of the notification aforesaid ,ANALYSIS
a96ada2601c548cd8c04712d8015371f,10334,10530,Now the ground of his attack was that it was not open to the Government in exercise of the authority delegated to it under s 6 2 of the Act to modify or alter what the Legislature had enacted ,ANALYSIS

5e5b86aa1918478a9229ffc8b8c44d66,10771,11051,In Civil Appeal No 254 of 1955 the appellants are the Jabalpur Contractors Association which is a registered body and certain contractors and they filed M P No 279 of 1954 questioning the validity of the proposed assessment on the same grounds as in M P No 245 of 1954 ,ANALYSIS
fa789433cd194c62a5ac77cb9177d85d,11052,11332,The appellant in Civil Appeal No 255 of 1955 is the Madhya Pradesh Contractors Association Nagpur which is again a registered body and it filed M P No 305 of 1954 challenging the legality of the proceedings for assessment on the same grounds as in M P No 245 of 1954 ,ANALYSIS
1269065726a44040a5cde0e08cafeaf9,11333,11798,All these three petitions were heard together and by their judgment dated November 30 1954 the learned Judges held that the expression sale of goods in Entry 48 was wide enough to coverall transactions in which property in the moveables passed from one person to another for money and that accordingly in a building contract there was a sale within Entry 48 of the materials used therein and that the provisions of the Act imposing tax thereon were valid ,ANALYSIS
70c715673d6e46ecad4f1c7d262d5f64,11799,12199,But the learned Judges also held that the tax could be levied only on the actual value of the materials to be determined on an enquiry into the matter and that the definition of price in s 2 h ii and r 4 framed pursuant thereto were ultra viresin that they laid down artificial rules for fixing the same by deducting certain percentages from out of the total receipts on account of labour ,ANALYSIS
b6bcc50d6b2e4a34902489d65e758877,12200,12350,As regards the notification dated September 18 1950 the learned Judges held that it was within the authority conferred by the statute and was valid ,ANALYSIS
7430473a7404449abfb15b4c7207a15b,12351,12519,In the result the impugned provisions of the Act were held to be valid except as to the definition of price in s 2 h ii and r 4 of the Sales Tax Rules 1947 ,ANALYSIS
e83bcbdeafc947e99f9cee207943baf4,12519,12672, It is against this judgment that the above appeals have been preferred on a certificate granted by the High Court under Art 132 1 of the Constitution ,ANALYSIS
4f02a1e136a44b18a766faac7b96dd60,12672,13094, Two contentions have been urged in support of the appeals 1 that the Provincial Legislature has no authority in exercise of its power under Entry 48 to impose a tax on the supply of materials in works contracts as such supply cannot be said to be also of those materials within that Entry and 2 that the notification dated September 18 1950 is bad as being an constitutional delegation of legislative authority ,ANALYSIS
641d8fee3b5044febef006b2e30ae06f,13094,13590, As regards the first contention the question is now concluded by the decision of this Court in The State of Madras v Gannon Dunkerley Co Madras Ltd 1 in which it has been held that the expression sale of goods in Entry 48 has the same meaning which it has in the Indian Sale of Goods Act 1930 that in a building contract there is no sale of materials as such and that it is therefore ultra vires the powers of the Provincial Legislature to impose tax on the supply of materials ,PRE_RELIED
145f19b578e24dfbad8181fb0335021f,13591,14310,Mr B Sen appearing for the respondents has argued that even if the expression sale of goods in Entry 48 is construed in the sense which it has in the Sale of Goods Act that might render the impugned provisions of the Act ultra vires only in respect of a building contract which is one and indivisible that there might be contracts which might consist of two distinct agreements one for the sale of materials and another for work and labour and that in such a case it would be competent to the State to impose tax on the sale of materials even construing that word in its 1 1959 S C R 379 434 narrow sense and that these are matters which must be left to be investigated by the appropriate authorities ,ARG_RESPONDENT
82bd7e11e60f420fabc349b6bf03e10b,14311,14932,That undoubtedly is the correct legal position as observed in The State of Madras v Gannon Dunkerley Co Madras Ltd 1 and accordingly when a question arises as to whether a particular works contract could be charged to sales tax it will be for the authorities under the Act to determine whether the agreement in question is on its true construction a combination of an agreement to sell and an agreement to work and if they come to the conclusion that such is its character then it will be open to them to pro ceed against that part of it which is a contract for the sale of goods and impose tax thereon ,ANALYSIS
4925832d3eb945cd81afc289d74bd960,14932,15100, 2 We have next to consider the contention that the notification dated September 18 1950 is bad as constituting an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power ,ANALYSIS
67226afd66f74c0186a1f26d81b9b5ec,15101,15490,In the view which we have expressed above that there is in a works contract no sale of materials as such it might seem academic to enter into a discussion of this question but as there may be building contracts in which it is possible to spell out agreements for the sale of materials as distinct from contracts for work and labour it becomes necessary to express our decision thereon ,ANALYSIS
a221e2d191ed4520bebba4024ce6c9c3,15491,15852,Mr Chatterjee appearing for the appellant in Civil Appeal No 253 of 1955 contends that the notification in question is ultra vires because it is a matter of policy whether exemption should be granted under the Act or not and a decision on that question must be taken only by the Legis lature and cannot be left to the determination of an outside authority ,ARG_PETITIONER
7689fa72fb1a4f0da68b0a7e66d805ca,15853,16187,While a power to execute a law it was argued could be delegated to the executive the power to make it must be exercised by the Legislature itself and reliance was placed on the observations in Hampton J R Co v United States 2 Panama Refining Co v Ryan 3 and Schechter v United States 4 as supporting this position ,ARG_PETITIONER
14bd9cf454c9445ea800f13d87152b13,16187,16991, It was also contended that the grant of a power to an outside authority to 1 1959 S C R 379 2 276 U S 394 72 L Ed 624 629 3 293 U S 388 79 L Ed 446 458 4 295 U S 495 79 L Ed 1570 repeal or modify a provision in a statute passed by the legislature was unconstitutional and that in consequence the impugned notification was bad in that in reversal of the policy laid down by the legislature in Act XVI of 1949 that sales to Government should be excluded from the operation of the Act it withdrew the exemption which had been granted thereunder and the observations in re The Delhi Laws Act 1912 etc 1 and the decision in Rajnarain Singh v The Chairman Patna Administration Committee Patna and another 2 were strongly relied on as establishing this contention ,ARG_PETITIONER
826c346c8e0e497fab136d39234c667c,16992,17276,Mr N C Chatterjee particularly relied on the following observations of Bose J at p 301 in Rajnarain Singh s case 2 In our opinion the majority view was that an executive authority can be authorised to modify either existing or future laws but not in any essential feature ,ARG_PETITIONER
67b466fdcd4d4b9a866988f81806ee11,17277,17525,Exactly what constitutes an essential feature cannot be enunciated in general terms and there was some divergence of view about this in the former case but this much is clear from the opinions set out above it cannot include a change of policy ,ARG_PETITIONER
4aaaf89851d94877b4300aee87cab430,17525,17726, On these observations the point for determination is whether the impugned notification relates to what may be said to be an essential feature of the law and whether it involves any change of policy ,ANALYSIS
976b530e4bcc4c00a434df47c91e4484,17727,18060,Now the authorities are clear that it is not unconstitutional for the legislature to leave it to the executive to determine details relating to the working of taxation laws such as the selection of persons on whom the tax is to be laid the rates at which it is to be charged in respect of different classes of goods and the like ,ANALYSIS
0725021bf83a4943ae4ada7ad264cf65,18060,18343, In Powell v Appollo Candle Company Limited the question arose as to whether s 133 of the Customs Regulation Act of 1879 of New South Wales which conferred a power on the Governor to impose tax on certain articles of import was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative powers ,PRE_RELIED
df6fb8eaa0a34406b59d7b8640b47346,18344,18618,In holding that it was not the Privy Council observed It is argued that the tax in question has been 1 1951 S C R 747 787 982 984 3 1885 10 A C 282 2 1955 1 S C R 290 imposed by the Governor and not by the Legislature who alone had power to impose it ,PRE_RELIED
5e18963caae34cd5ab7b308c041b8bb3,18619,18746,But the duties levied under the Order in Council are really levied by the authority of the Act under which the Order is issued ,PRE_RELIED
3e52f918510445b784efa378ca9786c0,18747,18937,The Legislature has not parted with its perfect control over the Governor and has the power of course at any moment of withdrawing or altering the power which they have entrusted to him ,PRE_RELIED
cc66a7204fd246d9b29f25a95cfdbd90,18938,19148,In these circumstances their Lordships are of opinion that the judgment of the Supreme Court was wrong in declaring Section 133 of the Customs Regulation Act of 1879 to be beyond the power of the Legislature ,PRE_RELIED
6b7f34bf02fa4b76905713d527673be0,19148,19296, In Syed Mohamed Co v The State of Madras 1 the question was as to the vires of rules 4 and 16 framed under the Madras General Sales Tax Act ,PRE_RELIED
73122216b0c247bca086b57e45a5a63b,19297,19616,Section 5 vi of that Act had left it to the rule making authority to determine at which single point in the series of sales by successive dealers the tax should be levied and pursuant thereto rules 4 and 16 had provided that it was the purchaser who was liable to pay the tax in respect of sales of hides and skins ,PRE_RELIED
936958ea42654baa940065ab7c197198,19617,19843,The validity of the rules was attacked on the ground that it was only the legislature that as competent to decide who shall be taxed and that the determination of that question by the rule making authorities was ultra vires ,PRE_RELIED
b8bcc0a8a51d44e189eebd1054fb3810,19844,20027,The Madras High Court rejected this conntetion and held on a review of the authorities that the delegation of authority under s 5 vi war within permissible constitutional limits ,PRE_RELIED
7bee643c859b4e50b17eb4cad2e166df,20027,20463, In Hampton J R Co v United States 2 which was cited on behalf of the appellant the question arose whether s 315 b of the Tariff Act 1922 under which the President had been empowered to make such increases and decreases in the rates of duty as were found necessary for carrying out the policies declared in the statute was an unconstitutional delegation and the decision was that such delegation was not unconstitutional ,PRE_RELIED
76e6f68861fa405280b1dc2c8658f14f,20464,20707,We are therefore of the opinion that the power conferred on the State Government by s 6 2 to amend the schedule relating to exemption is in consonance with the accepted legislative practice relating to the topic and is not unconstitutional ,ANALYSIS
6bafcf6afd79436bb721a957ac0bb515,20707,20896, 1 1952 3 S T C 367 2 276 U S 394 72 L Ed 624 629 The contention of the appellant that the notification in question is ultra vires must in our opinion fail on another ground ,ANALYSIS
7ff00c687e2540c8bc0fd4b5782f4550,20897,21260,The basic assumption on which the argument of the appellant proceeds is that the power to amend the schedule conferred on the Government under s 6 2 is wholly independent of the grant of exemption under s 6 1 of the Act and that in consequence while an exemption under s 6 1 would stand an amendment thereof by a notification under s 6 2 might be bad ,ANALYSIS
9ce467f780054c27b497b1cff47a2130,21261,21336,But that in our opinion is not the correct interpretation of the section ,ANALYSIS
7c47d108fcc6435285e8a0ff02e909de,21337,21574,The two sub sections together form integral parts of a single enactment the object of which is to grant exemption from taxation in respect of such goods and to such extent as may from time to time be determined by the State Government ,ANALYSIS
b00a7bdb295b4fe1ad99132d24fb3c53,21575,21769,Section 6 1 therefore cannot have an operation independent of s 6 2 and an exemption granted thereunder is conditional and sub ject to any modification that might be issued under s 6 2 ,ANALYSIS
c8cd9d721c4240e5ba7aceba4f217a34,21769,21851, In this view the impugned notification is intra vires and not open to challenge ,RATIO
669ea02f7f5d4b118e73a9e874eb1118,21851,22285, But on our finding on the first question that the impugned provisions of the Act are ultra vires the powers of the Provincial Legislature under Entry 48 in List 11 in the seventh Schedule we should set aside the orders of the Court below and direct that the respondents be restrained from enforcing the provisions of the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act 1947 in so far as they seek to impose a tax on construction works ,ANALYSIS
e87c990bf647421eb43525d40f82cb72,22286,22863,It should be made clear however in accordance with what we have already stated that the prohibition against imposition of tax is only in respect of contracts which are single and indivisible and not of contracts which are a combination of distinct contracts for sale of materials and for work and that nothing that we have said in this judgment shall bar the sales tax authorities from deciding whether a particular contract falls within one category or the other and imposing a tax on the agreement of sale of materials where the contract belongs to the latter category ,RATIO

5d4eff5dae8946f19962768c061053b8,23510,23694,Therefore it is not reasonably possible to accept the testimony of PW 7 and PW 8 when they professed that they have seen the appellant and the deceased together consuming the liquor ,ANALYSIS
b33b731731884b32bdbd907fe3045587,23695,23764,It is highly artificial and appears on its face a make believe story ,ANALYSIS
e641bb83eb704a6c832f3b5c3bb4a346,23764,23872, The next piece of evidence is the alleged extra judicial confession made by the appellant to PW 10 ,ANALYSIS
8097e9c2e2034a0fae8170dc34b95068,23873,24101,An unambiguous extra judicial confession possesses high probative value force as it emanates from the person who committed the crime and is admissible in evidence provided it is free from suspicion and suggestion of its falsity ,ANALYSIS
734d0b96868b4ead82b75a981501c9a0,24102,24435,But in the process of the proof of the alleged confession the court has to be satisfied that it is a voluntary one and does not appear to be the result of inducement threat or promise envisaged under section 24 of the Evidence Act or was brought about in suspicious circumstances to circumvent Section 25 and 26 of the Evidence Act ,ANALYSIS
8d779c186f704e01928b46a0c233e8a5,24436,24682,Therefore the court has to look into the surrounding circumstances and to find whether the extra judicial confession is not inspired by any improper or colateral consideration or circumvention of the law suggest ing that it may not be true one ,ANALYSIS
408a03a8ebaa4350b1550a50fcfb2d7c,24683,24921,For this purpose the court must scrutinise all the relevant facts such as the person to whom the confession is made the time and place of making it the circumstances in which it was made and finally the actual words used by the accused ,ANALYSIS
940e0a2951b549c9baad3b676ec96772,24922,25041,Extra judicial confession if found to be voluntary can be relied upon by the court alongwith other evidence on record ,ANALYSIS
ff4ab4056c5f4e0199425df24e06a93a,25042,25136,Therefore even the extra judicial confession will also have to be proved like any other fact ,ANALYSIS
9bdc1d3c8da240eca4a8b98d78d0b9b6,25137,25337,The value of the evidence as to the confes sion depends upon the verocity of the witness to whom it is made and the circumstances in which it came to be made and the actual words used by the accused ,ANALYSIS
6187ce751470480fa41119809fd09060,25338,25450,Some times it may not be possible to the witness to reproduce the actual words in which the confession was made ,ANALYSIS
24168b3e6b074d33b81521cbbc280a1e,25451,25639,For that reason the law insists on recording the statement by a Judicial Magistrate after administering all necessary warnings to the accused that it would be used as evidence against him ,ANALYSIS
f264c24b6ba347219ce3fc8cea665b64,25639,25711, Admittedly PW 10 and the appellant do not belong to the same village ,ANALYSIS
daab22a02a6d4e739ef004a2f9bcbfab,25712,25898,From the narrative of the prosecution story it is clear that PW 27 and PW 10 came together and appre hended the appellant from his village and was taken to Jassur for identification ,ANALYSIS
92b5369fb3ff4002835f17ced9f2c66f,25899,26079,After he was identified by PW 7 and PW 8 it was stated that he was brought back to Gaggal village of PW 10 and was kept in his company and PW 27 left for further investigation ,ANALYSIS
a630a49c66c4488a8b1e41d2b34f6617,26080,26223,Section 25 of the Evidence Act provides that no confession made to a police officer shall be proved as against a person accused of any offence ,STA
21a8262211dd4979af2ba0204188e32e,26223,26431, Section 26 provides that no confession made by any person while he is under custody of the police officer unless it be made in the immediate presence of a magistrate shall be proved as against such person ,STA
07f0fee96c9e41289cec3a8c4fac37e0,26432,26590,Therefore the confession made by an accused person to a police officer is irrelevant by operation of Section 25 and it shall be proved against the appellant ,ANALYSIS
19f2e9eff1264016bf38665247ed7444,26591,26819,Likewise the confession made by the appellant while he is in the custody of the police shall notbe proved against the appellant unless it is made in the immediate presence of the magistrate by operation of Sec tion 26 thereof ,ANALYSIS
773413f3a8c54e6799ed2c0c999f61d0,26820,26907,Admittedly the appellant did not make any confession in the presence of the magistrate ,ANALYSIS
d19994d111a140299073855beeb6b309,26908,27028,The question therefore is whether the appellant made the extra judicial confession while he was in the police custody ,ANALYSIS
d24864fa140646e38ace2a2a55260762,27029,27264,It is incred ible to believe that the police officer PW 27 after having got identified the appellant by PW 7 and PW 8 as the one last seen the deceased in his company would have left the appellant without taking him into custody ,ANALYSIS
40e3fdb068ee40f6a078649b36378572,27265,27516,It is obvious that with a view to avoid the rigour of Section 25 and 26 PW 27 created an artificial scenerio of his leaving for further investigation and kept the appellant in the custody of PW 10 the Pradhan to make an extra judicial confession ,ANALYSIS
8fbb3501ab9b477e9ea219b836898c51,27517,27753,Nothing prevented PW 27 to take the appellant to a Judicial Magistrate and had his confession recorded as provided under section 164 of the Crl P C which possesses great probative value and affords an unerring assurance to the court ,ANALYSIS
8360ea8b3172416fb7fc3194dc1c1733,27754,27910,It is too incredulous to believe that for mere asking to tell the truth the appellant made voluntarily confession to PW 10 and that too sitting in a hotel ,ANALYSIS
9a070b7cacdb4022afb2dddfe78356c9,27911,28051,The other person in whose presence it was stated to have been made was not examined to provide any corroboration to the testimony of PW 10 ,ANALYSIS
b93ac64fa871426d935e0aaa3eb0a121,28052,28288,Therefore it would be legitimate to conclude that the appellant was taken into the police custo dy and while the accused was in the custody the extra judicial confession was obtained through PW 10 who accommo dated the prosecution ,ANALYSIS
b88000c143364b2bafd6e0c42035942a,28289,28456,Thereby we can safely reach an irre sistible conclusion that the alleged extra judicial confes sion statement was made while the appellant was in the police custody ,ANALYSIS
b995258812344aefa205a3655f7a30b0,28457,28532,It is well settled law that Sections 25 and 26 shall be construed strictly ,ANALYSIS
9d833cf389314f7eba1c1cecca3fc528,28533,28740,Therefore by operation of Section 26 of the Evidence Act the confession made by the appellant to PW 10 while he was in the custody of the police officer PW 27 shall not be proved against the appellant ,ANALYSIS
0ed4a1d0e6304c4fa26580f14bf02a15,28741,28828,In this view it is unnecessary to go into the voluntary nature of the confession etc ,ANALYSIS
7657d0c498354fd4aa5940c47d3f40e0,28828,29099,The third circumstance relied on is the statement said to have been made by the appellant under section 27 of the Evidence Act leading to discovery of the consequential information namely saw blade is not of a conclusive nature connecting the appellant with the crime ,ANALYSIS
77d7d0c223434ba185ed797bb20d10ad,29100,29161,The recover ies were long after the arrest of the appellant ,ANALYSIS

91efff2ece644f50b9961cdb985994d3,29219,29283,So it was not possible to find whether it is human blood or not ,ANALYSIS
512ad3c5e183408e96b7ace8e2b42123,29284,29453,Moreover from the prosecution evidence it is clear that the deceased himself was an accused in an earlier murder case and it is obvious that he had enemies at his back ,ANALYSIS
ffe8eb9b688b4d6b941ffdda3cbb9e9c,29454,29523,Absolutely no motive to commit crime was attributed to the appellant ,ANALYSIS
0d49587ea8a543349e9654a07bcd5b4d,29523,29839, No doubt the appellant and two others have been charged for an offence under section 302 and 201 read with Section 34 namely common intention to commit the offences and A 2 and A 3 were acquitted of the charge under section 302 34 I P C and that there is no independent charge under section 302 I P C ,ANALYSIS
fc1817bc7bc34f8c96dccb3a57364290,29840,30128,If from the evidence it is established that any one of the accused have committed the crime individual ly though the other accused were acquitted even without any independent charge under section 302 the individual accused would be convicted under section 302 I P C sim plicitor ,ANALYSIS
0b3480e20e6c4032a0ae15fa877ccf34,30129,30271,The omission to frame an independent charge under section 302 I P C does not vitiate the conviction and sentence under section 302 I P C ,ANALYSIS
a634f52f52724c6a8988259dc8c2a525,30271,30748,Thus considered we find that the prosecution has utterly failed to prove any one of the three circumstances against the appellant and the chain of circumstances was broken at every stage without connecting the accused to the commission of the alleged crime as the prosecution failed to prove as a primary fact all the three circumstances much less beyond all reasonable doubt bringing home the guilt to the accused and to prove that the accused alone had committed the crime ,RATIO

6c1a4ce17b7b4ffea5d22907d8fe6dbe,689,874,The facts as found by the Tribunal are that the appellant was manufacturing coustic soda utilising billiter cells and up to the year 1956 its production capacity was 13 5 tons per day ,FAC
123747b107fd450d9bd44eaaff6997e1,875,1015,The appellant felt the need to expand its capacity and obtained a licence which permitted it to manufacture 20 tons of caustic soda per day ,FAC
b01470005e904b9db2698f614391cc3b,1017,1118,In order to increase the capacity the appellant gradually replaced billiter cells with hooker cells ,FAC
80ca79c6e7dd497291da760bec324173,1119,1216,Thirty hooker cells were installed by 31 3 1957 and thirty more were installed in February 1958 ,FAC
555a7d121e1941c0ab438bf3812f7c91,1217,1380,The installation of the hooker cells required a change over in the power system and the installation of a rectifier was completed only in the year ended 31 3 1959 ,FAC
cb8d4b7ca7ca4eb99b5e1e761c51946a,1381,1557,However the hooker cells were utilised for the production as and when they were installed by a suitable adjustment in the power system even before the rectifier was installed ,FAC
f50312a8ef8d44198bd0386eb1e47fc7,1558,1700,The position thus was that the production for the year 31 3 1957 included certain production attributable to the use of thirty hooker cells ,FAC
91a33de248e04d8095bd27a1923e985a,1701,1871,All the sixty hookers cells were installed by the end of 1958 and the installation of the unit together with the rectifier was also completed in the year ended 31 3 1959 ,FAC
aecd8f9c21a5495788e54f0d57ec9a5a,1872,2075,It was clear that the capacity of the unit gradually increased from the stage of the installation of the hooker cells though full capacity was reached only with the installation of all the hooker cells ,FAC
beb7a3cd864b4e1097e1f4cd25d30f8b,2075,2422, Claim was made by the appellant before Income Tax Officer to the effect that it was entitled to the relief under Section 84 of the Act in respect of assessment year 1962 63 on the ground that such relief is admissible for five assessment years starting from the year in which the industrial undertaking begins to manufacture or produce articles ,FAC
b540160fbae2418a811ac0bc5771e323,2423,2790,The contention of the appellant was that it had not claimed any relief in respect of assessment year 1957 58 when thirty of the sixty hooker cells had been installed and therefore the period of five years should commence only with effect from the year 1958 59 by which time the installation of the sixty hooker cells as well as the rectifier had been completed ,FAC
d47458e1a9a34bd88eedffa98417e588,2791,3120,In the alternative it was also contended that the appellant was entitled to relief atleast in relation to production of the thirty hooker cells which were installed for the first time in the assessment year 1958 59 as the fifth year for these hooker cells from the commencement of the production is the assessment year 1962 63 ,FAC
df939b71cccc4d978446a783c2fce902,3120,3232, The claim had been disallowed by the Income Tax Officer and in appeal by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner ,RLC
1de4c62d290748fbaf5f0d8355b3a7ed,3233,3580,The Income Tax Tribunal on the further appeal rejected the claim of the appellant by holding that though the industrial unit ultimately consisted of sixty hooker cells and the rectifier but it had commenced commercial production in the year ended 31 3 1957 and therefore the five years had to be reckoned from the year 1957 58 and not 1953 59 ,RLC
0b2a992d5e904345b50c210b3e8792b4,3582,3874,Another contention which was raised before the Revenue Authorities and the Tribunal was with regard to the deduction of development rebate which was allowable in respect of a new industrial undertaking in computing the profits and gains for the purpose of relief under Section 84 of the Act ,FAC
ac7ea08682ae424892332aad6082f570,3875,4040,In respect of assessment year 1962 63 the profits and gains from the new industrial unit had been computed at Rs 1 08 282 before adjustment for development rebate ,FAC
4e633027e09a4436bbc0018e20f8f85f,4041,4118,The total amount of development rebate had been determined at Rs 13 69 487 ,FAC
0f53ede007c3425cab8d3e1c27341ae1,4119,4388,Adjusting the development rebate towards this profit of Rs 1 08 282 the Income Tax Officer and the Appellate Assistant Commissioner held that there was no income from the new industrial undertaking on which relief was admissible under Section 84 1 of the said Act ,FAC
5ba91a4939b24ff894d0ec6b2d277aa6,4389,4600,The contention of appellant was that in arriving at the business income of industrial undertaking on which the relief under Section 84 1 of the Act was admissible the development rebate was not to be deducted ,FAC
50528241fe724850b764db6f717fafb2,4601,4655,This claim was not accepted by the Appellate Tribunal ,RLC
bdcc07199a374284b319d5ee7fa8bdbf,4656,4912,It came to the conclusion that on the correct interpretation of Section 84 of the Act the relief under the said provision was allowable only in case where there was a positive income of the industrial undertaking after the allowance of development rebate ,RLC
7ce1a9f871614740bf29e9ad95b7f49a,4912,5944, On an application being filed by the appellant the Tribunal referred the following three questions of law to the High Court 1 Whether the first year in which the assessee was entitled to relief in respect of the new industrial undertaking was the assessment year 1957 58 and whether the assessee was entitled to relief in respect of the assessment for 1962 63 under Section 84 2 Even if the assessee is not entitled to the full relief in respect of 60 hooker cells claimed in respect of the assessment for 1962 63 whether it is entitled to relief in respect of the thirty hooker cells completed during the previous year for 1958 59 3 Whether development rebate in respect of the new industrial undertaking established during the previous year for 1962 63 should be deducted in computing the profits and gains for the purpose of section 84 and whether the assessee is entitled to any relief under the assessee is entitled to any relief under that section in respect of this undertaking ,ISSUE
d532692015db4718b503085a2bc7f8f3,5944,6055,The High Court agreeing with the Tribunal answered the aforesaid questions of law in favour of the respondent ,FAC
0da623f0cbff4ef2a8673227671f448b,6056,6133,On leave to appeal being refused this Court granted special leave to appeal ,FAC
347b2683012743d98fbb803836985cbc,6134,6153,Hence this appeal ,FAC
c82b9dc4e7e24d8cbf58d1f48ee9f5bf,6153,6602, Taking the first two questions together it was contended by Shri Ramachandran learned counsel for the appellant that the new industrial undertaking was entitled to the benefit of the provisions of Section 84 of the Act corresponding to Section 15 c of the Income Tax Act 1922 in the year 1962 63 because the new industrial undertaking consisted of sixty hooker cells and rectifier and the same were installed only in the year 1958 59 ,ARG_PETITIONER
3789344028184254a04e5f2774cb2149,6603,6769,It was also contended that in respect of the year 1957 58 no claim was made under the said provision because the assessee had by then not completed the installation ,ARG_PETITIONER
71c7510ee68843e69eef8ef4ab5be69e,6769,7051, According to Section 84 of the Act income tax is not payable by an assessee on so much of the profits and gains inter alia derived from any industrial undertaking to which the Section applies as does not exceed 6 per annum on the capital employed in such undertaking ,STA
b329954b630543168167df7b87050b5d,7052,7204,Sub section 2 of Section 84 provides the conditions which should be specified so as to enable the assessee to enjoy the benefit of the said provision ,STA
d8af0fac41ac4ca6b571023502c800cd,7205,7918,It is not in dispute that these conditions are satisfied but what we are concerned in this case is with regard to the applicability of sub section 7 of Section 84 of the Act which reads as follows The provisions of this section shall in relation to an industrial undertaking apply to the assessment i for the assessment year relevant to the previous year in which the undertaking begins to manufacture or produce articles or as the case may be operate the cold storage plant or plants and ii where the assesee is a co operative society for the six assessment years immediately succeeding and where the assessee is any other person for the four assessment years immediately succeeding ,STA
91fc05fa92cb417fb0baa92817cc96f6,7918,8081,It is found as a fact that the appellant had begun to manufacture or produce articles in the previous year ended on 31 3 1957 with the help of thirty hooker cells ,ANALYSIS
f9451829ddce4fc19385ecdb9d3534e6,8082,8299,It is true that rectifier had not been installed in the year 1957 58 but it not in dispute that with suitable adjustment being made to the power system the thirty hooker cells which had been installed were utilised ,ANALYSIS
7bb89b253ca74139afdc62accd41fd52,8300,8463,The use of these new hooker cells had resulted in the capacity of the unit gradually increasing and the production so made was not experimental but was commercial ,ANALYSIS
4e51693f5f304f5787450f462a3042ba,8464,8623,This being so the appellant s undertaking must be regarded as having been newly established when it had begun to manufacture or produce articles by 31 3 1957 ,ANALYSIS
3cdb3c8b224a4555bce1bdcac2ec72be,8624,8991,As 1957 58 was the first assessment year in which the relief under Section 15 C of the Income Tax Act 1922 corresponding to Section 84 of the Act could have been claimed the four succeeding years would end by 1961 62 with the result that the appellant would not be entitled to any relief in the year 1962 63 which was rightly regarded as the sixth assessment year ,ANALYSIS
5a3b8ab2a39445f9b16bc8bf018e94ca,8992,9168,In answer to question No 1 the High Court therefore rightly come to the conclusion that the first year in which the relief could be claimed was the assessment year 1957 58 ,RATIO
c0636501dd9d4fe4b0caae9e8b4b8181,9170,9602,As regards question No 2 is concerned it was alternatively submitted that thirty hooker cells and the rectifier were installed in the year 1958 59 and therefore benefit under Section 84 of the Act with regard to these thirty hooker cells should be available in the year 1962 63 This is a case where the manufacturing capacity of the appellant was increased on a licence being granted from 13 5 tons per day to 20 tons per day ,ANALYSIS
950a43e4f2d64a6fa7fa3512b6d4db4a,9603,9700,In other words these hooker cells were installed and the billiter cells were gradually replaced ,ANALYSIS
08e95af83f5c42209bd80f7eaa3e117b,9701,9884,The new industrial undertaking came into existence when the initial lot of thirty hooker cells were installed in the year 1957 58 which had resulted in enhanced commercial production ,ANALYSIS
fe85aa1bb1c64349bd82988ec60dd956,9885,10100,The Tribunal and the High Court in our opinion rightly came to the conclusion that the undertaking could function with thirty hooker cells in the year 1957 58 and further numbers were added in the subsequent year ,ANALYSIS
c0c4c2a93b594b94a7a6df0358e4d6e3,10101,10401,The undertaking having thus started the commercial manufacture in the year 1957 58 could not claim the benefit of provisions of Section 84 of the Act because the unit as such had commenced in the year 1957 58 notwithstanding the fact that there had been an expansion thereto in the subsequent year ,ANALYSIS
ae352e5082254431a12b0ae930dbb928,10402,10523,There was no scope for allowing a partial relief or splitting up of the relief as and when fresh cells came to the added ,ANALYSIS
75ba0b6d412c4305bb65104b36cb32f5,10524,10626,The question No 2 therefore was thus rightly answered in the negative and in favour of the revenue ,RATIO
99103ba92c954853985edd5d1f9aaab0,10626,10917, Coming to the third question the relevant fact as already stated is that the profit with reference to the additional unit of sixty hooker cells which was called caustic soda plant No 2 was worked out by the appellant at Rs 1 08 282 before allowing the allowing the development rebate ,ANALYSIS
992c82887435448185580333c8a4a5ef,10918,10997,The development rebate pertaining to this second plant came to Rs 12 15 055 ,ANALYSIS
1f70f75889f543239b64248b060b4d23,10998,11126,If the development rebate was adjusted against the sum of Rs 1 08 282 then the net result would be a loss of Rs 11 06 773 ,ANALYSIS
e9227ed2693e4b829f77e0bce98a1a3e,11127,11221,There would thus be no profit which would be eligible for the relief under Section 84 of Act ,ANALYSIS
50dd66a0341e45cfb930681bce1ec261,11222,11457,In order to avail of this relief the submission of the appellant is that the development rebate should not be deducted in arriving at the business income because it had no bearing on the business profits of the industrial undertaking ,ANALYSIS
3e5e2acd043d4789a4a616e316cc3000,11457,11650, In view of the decision of this Court in the case of Cambay Electric Supply Industrial Co Ltd Vs Commissioner of Income tax Gujarat II 113 ITR 84 this question is no longer res integra ,PRE_RELIED
3c310fbe44d74201811da79b1dd3290e,11651,12134,Dealing with a similar provision i e 80 E of the Act prior to its amendment by the Finance No 2 Act 1967 this Court came to the conclusion that in computing the profits of the assessee for the purpose of the special deduction provided under Section 80 E items of unabsorbed depreciation and unabsorbed development rebate carried forward from earlier years will have to be deducted before arriving at the figure from which the 8 contemplated by Section 80E is to be deducted ,PRE_RELIED
ee330cdff8544357b9c519928d604f45,12136,12406,In an effort to distinguish the aforesaid decision it was submitted by Mr Ramachandran that under Section 33 2 of the Act development rebate is deducted from the total income of an assessee and it is not a component or a ingredient for determining profits and gains ,ANALYSIS
100144ee7f254cbfa36366056c7c7436,12407,12715,In other words in Computing the profits and gains under Section 84 5 of the Act there must first be a deduction under Section 84 1 of the Act of 6 per annum an the capital employed on the caustic soda plant No 2 and it is only thereafter the development rebate should be deducted from the total income ,ANALYSIS
cfe30cb0804c4c38b3c4f50255048e02,12716,12897,In support thereof reliance was placed on the judgment of the Punjab Haryana High Court in Commissioner of Income tax Patiala I Vs Patiala Flour Mills Co P Ltd 127 ITR 301 ,PRE_RELIED
dddc0d2968e84ff9ba14ea0e0a492022,12898,13460,As already observed in Cambay Electric Supply Industrial Company s case supra while interpreting a provision similar to Section 84 5 of the Act this Court has held that the profits and gains from an industrial undertaking to which Section applies have to be computed in accordance with the provisions contained in Chapter IV d of the Act and development rebate has first to be deducted from the total income and it is only thereafter if any profits and gains remain from this business that the benefit under Section 84 1 of the Act would be applicable ,ANALYSIS
7147d3ecaa714341aab3ea1b07387874,13460,13692,It appears that the aforesaid decision of this Court in Cambay Electric Supply Industrial Company s case supra was not brought to the notice of Punjab Haryana High Court in the aforesaid case of Patiala Flour Mills case supra ,ANALYSIS
645236d1d6a24a19b17c8fe7e93870f3,13693,13783,It is clear that the decision of Patiala Flour Mills case supra is no longer a good law ,RATIO

51ede14aa945483c8aab2066083eee2c,8575,8713,Otherwise also it does not appeal to common sense that a ball would strike the gun in appellant s hand resulting in an undesigned firing ,ANALYSIS

616a86c16c244a85a7080b7a65a634ae,8844,8962, Appellant s attempt to shelter behind Section 304A IPC is thus an exercise in futility and is liable to be rejected ,ANALYSIS
bb376ca1ff5843229a13c962d3382194,8963,9293,14 In this backdrop the short question which falls for consideration is whether the appellant s act of causing death of Smt Anita and Khushal Singh tantamounts to offence of murder as held by the trial court and the High Court or any lesser offence as urged by Shri Siddharth Luthra learned senior counsel for the appellant ,ANALYSIS
7881d4f39c4843b19d505be6b4a6f0b0,9294,9493,Sections 299 as well as 300 IPC provide for situations in which death is caused by an act with the intention of causing death or such bodily injury which the offender knows is likely to cause death ,ANALYSIS
041b23a2a40644dd84656776a172acae,9494,9716,Both Sections 299 and 300 deal with instances in which death is caused by an act with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause death of the person to whom injury is inflicted ,STA
361d12cb3fa44496a6951d0660a5e002,9717,9872,These provisions also deal with cases where there is no intention of either causing death or a bodily injury which is ordinarily sufficient to cause death ,STA
6d07d14faa6a4f39831994cf2dabf41a,9873,10024,The absence of intention to cause death or bodily injury which is in the ordinary course of nature likely to cause death is therefore not conclusive ,STA
ff9ac2fd25b94cd28dc9959a1f1dfe77,10025,10187,What is required to be seen is whether the act is one where the offender must be deemed to have had the knowledge that he was likely by such act to cause death ,STA
14af82874c184d57ab44da18857ab074,10188,10576,15 The trial court as well as the High Court have proceeded on the premise that the appellant s act by firing from the gun which was pointed towards the roof was as bad as firing into a crowd of persons so he ought to have known that his act of gunshot firing was so imminently dangerous that it would in all probability cause death or such bodily injury as was likely to cause death ,ANALYSIS

7ea2127246f847189ee72d255480d3bc,11449,11622,The appellant is thus guilty of an act the likely consequences of which including causing fatal injuries to the persons being in a close circuit are attributable to him ,ANALYSIS
ffb2f75c1fcb4bb7b72f7a669a064939,11623,11794,The offence committed by the appellant thus would amount to culpable homicide within the meaning of Section 299 though punishable under Section 304 Part 2 of the IPC ,ANALYSIS

29c65ef2032d472c85f3a34ab4de5937,12129,12346,Appellant cannot escape the consequences of carrying the gun with live cartridges with the knowledge that firing at a marriage ceremony with people present there was imminently dangerous and was likely to cause death ,ANALYSIS

6e211cbac7464d0b83a39e638e733292,8517,8772,He further contended that the accused has confessed his guilt before the informant PW 1 his son so there is no reason to disbelieve the version of PW 1 and conviction can be based on his testimony as confession of the accused was free and voluntary ,ARG_PETITIONER
484bf53b227b4180a487010fd81556d8,8772,9056,On the contrary the learned defence counsel contended that the sole evidence of PW 1 relating to extra judicial confession of the accused is not free from doubt hence in such circumstances no conviction can be based solely on his version without any other independent corroboration ,ARG_RESPONDENT
cee40a5e80844f7c8f09f633ede58638,9057,9111,Hence she has prayed for an acquittal of the accused ,ARG_RESPONDENT
1e631d267e984cb499ca98b210852074,9112,9498,In support of her contention the learned defence counsel relied upon a case law as it is reported in 2011 49 OCR 662 Sukun Kisan versus State of Orissa wherein Their Lordship held that mere absence of inducement threat or promise is not enough to make the confession admissible but the person making must be expecting the gain in advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature ,ARG_RESPONDENT

e1628774cdc84c4880eed65e520bcbac,10847,11271,14 In fact in a case of murder it is the bounden duty on the part of prosecution first to establish that the injuries inflicted on the deceased were all homicidal and anti mortem in nature and then to prove that the accused had inflicted the injuries causing such death either intentionally or with knowledge that the injuries inflicted on the victim were sufficient enough in ordinary course of nature to cause the death ,ANALYSIS
34a0ac4a33d044f3a4f94e76647c0764,11272,11361,The prosecution case may be proved by direct evidence or through circumstantial evidence ,ANALYSIS
72357820e9264671bc2de115be52b2e2,11362,11471,If the direct evidence is clear and cogent a conviction can be based on such evidence without any other aid ,ANALYSIS
f3c988b6945c4889b85a3c98a5b6c07f,11472,11769,Similarly conviction can be based on circumstantial evidence only if the chain of evidence is so completed as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been done by the accused ,ANALYSIS
f3f0888d95364f509b039a6386472d54,11770,11912,So it is essential in the eye of law that the chain of circumstances aiming at the guilt of the accused should be completed without any break ,ANALYSIS
6248d7a5045b4040bc099688225d2e00,11913,11995,Admittedly in the present case at hand there is no eye witness to the occurrence ,ANALYSIS

b01aaa28275a4d10bb5210a35eac82fb,12102,12317,Only PW 1 the informant son of the deceased stated in his evidence that the accused has confessed his guilt admitting to have committed the murder of Mangri by assaulting her with a tangia during a family quarrel ,ANALYSIS
a322dc278ad4499e8e5ab7cbb84f482e,12318,12424,Beside such piece of evidence there is no other evidence on record to implicate the accused in this case ,ANALYSIS

50ca4fedbe5d49dcae834950d5186a6b,12570,12774,So at this juncture it is now the duty of the Court to make thorough scrutiny on the evidence of PW 1 relating to extra judicial confession of the accused as it is claimed by the prosecution in this case ,ANALYSIS
91871ff7836a44149c62312e5ab340aa,12775,12862,It is admitted fact that PW 1 is none but the son of both the deceased and the accused,ANALYSIS
9746df168aa2474fa8f9eaff23843fca,12862,13009, PW 1 further fairly admitted in his evidence that he was absent from his house at the time of such incident as he had gone outside for his wages ,ANALYSIS
89ebae35f4ed4838801113e99a484a47,13010,13210,It is in his evidence that during the noon time while he had come back to his house he found the dead body of his mother Mangri was falling inside their house with severe bleeding injury at her neck ,ANALYSIS
a748c9f35d1d43e4b15ffbe910afb216,13211,13412,He further noticed that his father accused was sitting near the dead body of his mother who had admitted to have committed the murder of Mangri by assaulting her with a tangia during a family quarrel ,ANALYSIS
f60dc359460a46e4abbe6f3257e54788,13413,13509,This part of his evidence found well corroborated to the facts that he has mentioned in his FIR ,ANALYSIS
8f6ed23b7be2476ba7e0e005f468da4d,13510,13751,In his FIR the informant PW 1 specifically stated that the accused has confessed his guilt before him admitting to have committed the murder of his mother that he has reported to the police in the earliest opportunity while filing his FIR ,ANALYSIS
280306f6954d4d869ca21c03e9f3e057,13752,13947,Similarly PW 1 the informant also stated in his statement recorded u s 161 Cr P C by the I O that the accused told him that he has committed murder of his wife by assaulting her with a tangia ,ANALYSIS
9de2367be3964d7caab6f1e078ca09b8,13948,14116,So while assessing the evidence of PW 1 we have now to keep in mind the basic principle as enunciated by the case laws while considering the extra judicial confession ,ANALYSIS
1081a14786d84003be4da8a0fffe9f2c,14117,14548,The learned defence counsel at the time of argument relied on a case law as it is reported in 2015 II OLR 614 Dasia Kanhu another versus State of Orissa wherein Their Lordship while considering the case of extra judicial confession came to Their findings that the extra judicial confession of the accused should be free and voluntary unless it is hazardous to base any conviction on such evidence of extra judicial confession ,ARG_RESPONDENT
864126619b7c428ba8aa29dc8261d38a,14549,14689,She has further contended that PW 1 did not ascertain from his accused father the reasons for which he has committed the murder of his wife ,ARG_RESPONDENT
eb012049e2234d56b4200f07b9b3c8d3,14690,14849,It was further contended by the defence that no where in his evidence PW 1 stated the reasons for which the accused has committed murder of his mother Mangri ,ARG_RESPONDENT
a1ca4f7db7b54160bee9393592e1c3fa,14850,14964,So the bald statement of the witness regarding such extra judicial confession is not acceptable in the eye of law ,ARG_RESPONDENT
a1497504ae7d46cc85c7f2488c553ea5,14965,15202,On the contrary the learned Additional P P contended that there is no circumstance before the Court to disbelieve the version of PW 1 as he is none but the son of the accused who has no ill motive to implicate the accused in this crime ,ARG_PETITIONER
e80bde77ab964cefb1f818d55ddfd127,15203,15373,He further contended that the evidence of PW 1 is found truthful without any exaggeration hence his evidence can be relied upon to base a conviction against the accused ,ARG_PETITIONER
8abee57e48ee4f749822f26d4d3ea470,15374,15549,So keeping in mind the contentions of both the sides we are now to go through some leading case laws on extra judicial confession as it were propounded by the Hon ble Courts ,ANALYSIS
0a76d19e26fa4a9a9ff38d559aff4073,15550,15790,In a case law as it is reported in 2014 Supp II OLR 999 Hari Dehury versus State of Orissa Their Lordship held that evidentiary value of the extra judicial confession must be judged in the facts and circumstances of each individual case ,PRE_RELIED
ed629a46f16e470cb69f0681e6e05b23,15791,15940,If such extra judicial confession is voluntary and consistent with the circumstantial evidence then only the guilt of the accused can be established ,PRE_RELIED
1d54c4652b8b4bf3b00e37aa7cf4f554,15941,16222,In another case law as it is reported in 2009 I OLR 548 State of Orissa versus Mulia Adapadia Their Lordship held that unless the extra judicial confession is made voluntarily before a witness on whom the accused has trust and confidence such statement should not be acted upon ,PRE_RELIED
b7f3d3f011fc4a5fa1c076d13fbebd1c,16223,16591,In another case as it is reported in 2011 49 OCR SC 712 Sk Yusuf versus State of West Bengal Their Lordship of the Hon ble Apex Court held that extra judicial confession is certainly a weak piece of evidence but if it is true and voluntary and made in a free state of mind then it is credible one and conviction can be based on such extra judicial confession ,PRE_RELIED
ceeb6a8ff42e4912bea2f0e6fd308d2f,16592,16847,Similarly in another case as it is reported in 2012 52 OCR SC 435 Sahadeb and another vesus State of Tamilnadu Their Lordship of the Hon ble Apex Court has formulated certain principles while considering the extra judicial confession of the accused ,PRE_RELIED

bcf2351347ce4b2cbe3102f07ad9770b,17515,17638,So keeping in mind the ratios of the case laws cited above we have now to make thorough analysis on the evidence of PW 1 ,ANALYSIS
817d62465993453184d65fd34f71c2a8,17639,17841,As it is previously discussed that PW 1 is none but the son of the deceased and the accused normally there is no possibility on his part to implicate his father accused falsely in such a heinous crime ,ANALYSIS
79c4b99a2e1e43bb81b2a2a962a584b9,17842,17983,It is clear from the evidence of PW 1 that he came back to his house while he found the dead body of his mother was falling inside the house ,ANALYSIS
0303db9c4e464e70946c687ed2280b36,17984,18173,He further found that his father was sitting by the side of the deceased who had voluntarily told him that he has killed his mother by assaulting her with a tangia during a family quarrel ,ANALYSIS
77bc468c2cb54f588eb02b6f7275d920,18174,18279,The circumstance never suggests that there was coercion or threat on the accused to make such confession ,ANALYSIS
8a30bbf00ae84c3eb6f7980ec87d0066,18280,18473,It is also abundantly clear that the person before whom the accused has confessed his guilty was his son and normally one can repose confidence on his kith and kin while making such confession ,ANALYSIS
9e396c7e15f8444fb0c24ec1f99be85b,18474,18593,No other animosity between the son and accused father was established by the defence to discredit the evidence of PW 1 ,ANALYSIS
8ee290d89f92409f8f03a1c2d2920394,18594,18739,So the confession of the accused in my considered opinion was certainly voluntary and truthful that inspires confidence in the mind of the Court ,ANALYSIS
a30c7131f8a44a019d7452b6176d43c4,18740,18863,The circumstance of the case also corroborates the fact of confession of the accused as it is claimed by PW 1 in this case ,ANALYSIS
3fc13d08a35b4c95a7b3bfb7ac65693b,18864,19028,The I O PW 14 who had reached the spot soon after receiving information from the Grama Rakhi found the accused while he was sitting near the dead body of his wife ,ANALYSIS
7be98615fffd48ac89805dcbcf6ac6ca,19029,19157,The I O further stated in his evidence that he has seen the weapon of offence a tangia that the accused has kept near the spot ,ANALYSIS
0ca2e2592be946d8a359b4b58729521c,19158,19355,The M O PW 11 before whom the weapon of offence the axe was produced noticed blood stain marks on it that also equally corroborates to the fact of killing of the deceased by such weapon an axe ,ANALYSIS
4ac4f55347354ace9b6c1208a1941863,19356,19535,So the whole circumstances of this case clearly suggest me to believe that the accused has killed his wife Mangri during a family quarrel by assaulting her brutally with a tangia ,ANALYSIS
257b9c7500df4be5933420db619046dc,19536,19652,Such extra judicial confession of the accused is accepted in this case as it is found free voluntary and truthful ,ANALYSIS
8e85060a69ff4ec09c70f052444b360d,19653,19839,There is no ambiguity in the mind of the Court to disbelieve such extra judicial confession of the accused as no other contrary is proved by the defence to discard such evidence of PW 1 ,ANALYSIS
80ce52b7322e43688259eae20da76022,19840,20012,Though PW 1 was extensively cross examined by the defence but nothing tangible could be brought out to disbelieve such version on extra judicial confession of the accused ,ANALYSIS
7e7f4c25ecdf4ea799489f188828acae,20013,20060,So I repose confidence on the evidence of PW 1 ,ANALYSIS
8d05b1c31a5541249a9decf576a49ad8,20060,20240, Hence it is held that in fact the accused has killed his wife Mangri Munda by assaulting her with a tangia and as such the confession was free and voluntary hence it is accepted ,ANALYSIS
35e71bbb0fb948cfaf3d5b7f5eefa0da,20241,20357,So in such circumstances we have now to further make scrutiny on the circumstances in which the death was occurred ,ANALYSIS
fce10054951a48bb8bc7a9a726631ba6,20358,20575,15 The learned defence counsel at the time of argument alternatively urged that in case the prosecution case is believed then also it never falls u s 302 of IPC as the accused has not killed his wife intentionally ,ANALYSIS
ee6dc7bedc9e41c6bc5403dc979abeff,20576,20714,So she has submitted that at best the accused can be punished u s 304 Part II of IPC in case the entire prosecution case is established ,ANALYSIS
578931a513564ea49a5ca1fe71fa0a04,20714,21570, 16 Section 300 IPC defines murder speaks that when the culpable homicide is committed with intention to causing death clause firstly or with the intention of causing such bodily injury which the offence knows is likely to cause death of the person to whom the harm is caused clause secondly or if it is done with the intention of causing bodily injuries which is intentionally inflicted and such bodily injury is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death of the deceased clause thirdly or the offender committed culpable homicide by an act which he knows that it is imminently so dangerous that in all probability such act is likely to cause death of the deceased or likely to cause any injury as is likely to cause death without any excuse for causing the death or such bodily injury clause fourthly the same amounts to murder ,STA
61a39757d44a44639ce897f64c9a4d67,21571,21722,But such culpable homicide shall not amount to murder if the same is done in any of the circumstances provided in the exception to Section 300 of IPC ,STA
c9f31c124d02438eadf1cbacd6380a85,21723,22178,Culpable homicide caused in the circumstances mentioned in clause Istly to Clause 3rdly to Section 300 of IPC if covered by any of the five exceptions there in the said section the same would attract the ingredients of charge u s 304 Part I of IPC but when caused in the circumstances provided in Clause 4thly by Section 300 of IPC and covered by any of the five exceptions the same would attract the ingredients of Section 304 Part II of IPC 17 ,STA
c263fd3cf33040afa2c748e52b27fb70,22179,22434,So keeping in view the principles stated above now we have to go through the evidence on record in order to arrive at our conclusion whether the prosecution case falls u s 302 of IPC or it falls u s 304 Part II of IPC as it is claimed by the defence ,ANALYSIS
aac65d1f425b43008cb4cca829779240,22435,22727,In a case law as it is reported in 2009 44 OCR 938 Khaga Khageswat Naik and others versus State of Orissa wherein Their Lordship held that where the incident took place without any pre plan but in a heat of passion then it falls u s 304 Part II of IPC instead of section 302 of IPC ,PRE_RELIED

b07dcc53efa44cda9b34f185ace9e4d8,23096,23410,In another case law as it is reported in 2005 11 SCC 536 Tanka Chain versus State Their Lordship held that when there is no motive to cause death section 300 of IPC is not attracted but if the assailant knew that the said injury is likely to cause the death the conviction will be u s 304 Part II of IPC ,PRE_RELIED
220b9adee612486bae12873b202fa01e,23411,23743,Similarly in another case law as it is reported in 2000 7 SCC 2249 State versus Indarjit Their Lordship held that absence of intention to cause a death coupled with lack of knowledge that death would be inevitably caused on account of the injury would make an offence falls only u s 304 Part II of IPC but not u s 302 of IPC ,PRE_RELIED
b67e58c7054249a5a76ffaaeb348a8f2,23743,23944, Admittedly the present incident happened during a family quarrel and during that quarrel with a heat of passion the accused has dealt blows with a tangia at the neck of his wife while causing murder ,RATIO
706bac59f9f84625a1883fb7b61c2bbb,23945,24105,There was no intention on the part of the accused to cause the murder of his wife nor it is established through the evidence that it was a pre planned murder ,RATIO
2b154fa095944bb4803e044c0836e86b,24106,24269,It happened due to sudden quarrel without any intention of causing murder though the blows were fatal in nature and inflicted with a dangerous weapon like tangia ,RATIO

ed57a6d220c340f8899bd61c5272c742,2258,2945, After hearing both the parties the said order passed by the learned Magistrate has been modified to the effect that the present petitioner husband Ajith Nayak has to surrender his passport within 15 days from the date of order of the appellate court before the trial court and trial court is directed to take custody of the passport of Ajith Nayak and further the trial court is also directed to consider the application of Ajith Nayak permitting him to go to foreign countries as and when required only for limited period without obstructing the court proceedings The orders of both the trial court and appellate court are called in question before this court in this petition 3 ,RLC
54b3639362de4c6f93b077e59d5affb1,2946,3253,The learned counsel for petitioner strenuously submitted that the petitioner is gainfully employed in IBM Company and often he has to go to foreign countries to obey the orders of the company if pass port is seized he may loose his job and in that event he will be put to great inconvenience and injustice ,ARG_PETITIONER
74b65cd934fd418bb8dc3b66752bf26a,3255,3412,4 Per contra the respondent Smt Shreelatha Nayak submitted before court that the petitioner has harassed her like anything and he made her life miserable ,ARG_RESPONDENT

f4a52e1ae52b4027947e6f09afe409ab,3617,4009, 5 After hearing the arguments of both sides and on perusal of the orders of the trial court and as well as appellate court it is seen from the orders and as well as submissions made before the courts below it is stated that the petitioner has no intention to go to foreign countries and settle there itself and he has also no intention to avoid proceedings filed against him by his wife ,ANALYSIS
1c457fd839d24cea99369f225a5f7be7,4010,4150,Further the petitioner under took that he will not obstruct court proceedings and he will not misuse the liberty given to him by the court ,ANALYSIS
a3819e45fcb04c1b899ce902bc4215bc,4150,4559, 6 On perusal of the above said materials on record it is clear that if the pass port of the petitioner is seized by the court it would inevitably cause inconvenience to the petitioner because as it is mentioned that he is gainfully employed in IBM Company and he cannot expect at what circumstance and what time company would direct him to go to foreign country in connection with the work of the company ,ANALYSIS
678cd022e8b344d4bac641dbc6887c09,4560,4853,Therefore if the pass port is seized and direction is issued to him that on every occasion he has to make an application seeking release of the pass port and attend work in the foreign country and come back and surrender pass port it would definitely create hardship and inconvenience to him ,ANALYSIS
e5e9014bc40d490488ad42e696acb881,4853,5086, 7 The sole object of seizing pass port by the trial court and appellate court is to see that petitioner should attend the court as and when required by the court and also assist the court in disposing of the matter at the earlier ,RATIO
c326dc34298045c99d04d75d22f97257,5087,5250,On putting reasonable conditions on the petitioner by modifying the order of the trial court and appellate court in my opinion it would meet the ends of justice ,RATIO
1a49bfadcbd446ffb7dec5ae040bcb47,5251,5736,Therefore I direct the trial court to release the pass port in favour of the petitioner if already surrendered or not to insist for surrender of the passport if not yet surrendered subject to the condition that petitioner has to intimate the court as and when he proposed to leave the country to foreign country and he must specifically mention that when he is actually leaving the country to which country and on what order of the company and that when he is coming back to India ,ANALYSIS
cec0dabbdb2040b28c8688a752f9da81,5737,6008,Thereafter the petitioner shall also appear before court as and when required or directed by the trial court in order to assist the court for disposal of the case and he shall not misuse the release of pass port with a view to permanently settle in the foreign country ,ANALYSIS

8f8889dfec994a7a8085f26e77313b20,1511,1700,2 The present appellants were accused before the Trial Court and have been convicted for the offences punishable under Sections 143 148 341 326 read with 149 of Indian Penal Code 1908 ,RLC
c4b17e90ae3e4b5d85a7d1d47a645af1,1702,1745,3 The facts leading up to this appeal are ,NONE
ef4f871b4afe41a8a21f1a4ae8df2481,1745,1858, It was the case of the prosecution that Chidananda the complainant was a resident of Byragondanahalli Village ,FAC
4f361c800a7d421b8851fd0d5525a9e2,1859,2023,He had gone to Arasikere on 23 2 2005 in order to see off his wife who was travelling in a bus and thereafter he was returning on his motorcycle at about 10 30 a m ,FAC
e3845b84af804382821096bc6599ab26,2024,2447,When he neared his village Bendekere he saw a motor van bearing registration No KA 14 3474 being driven at high speed on the wrong side of the road approaching him and therefore he tried to avoid the vehicle by turning his motorcycle but however accused No 1 Basavaraju who was driving the vehicle intercepted his motorcycle and dashed against him as a result of which plaintiff is said to have fallen to the ground ,FAC
19265388a0f3469d8b2b8eaa297ca705,2448,2897,Thereafter the accused had emerged from the motor van and on seeing them the plaintiff picked himself up and started running but accused No 1 Basavaraju who was holding an iron rod chased him and assaulted him on the right leg with it as a result of which the complainant fell to the ground at which time Dharanesha accused No 8 and Ramesha accused No 2 had assaulted him with wooden clubs and accused Nos 3 to 5 assaulted him with their hands ,FAC
12b0d32f4d224447a05ec2de97c30646,2897,3102, 4 It was claimed by the prosecution that accused No 1 Basavaraju had stood for the Panchayat elections and one Ramesha was his rival candidate and the complainant had supported Ramesha at the elections ,FAC
ef10c98cd78e4f20b3c94a5d8fd9664f,3103,3224,The accused were peeved by the fact that he had supported Ramesha and therefore the pre meditated attack on the victim ,FAC
299b40a6a24e45daa6e2e747c151115f,3225,3676,It is also stated that Basavaraju apart from assaulting the victim with an iron rod had picked up a size stone and attempted to drop it on the head of the complainant when he was lying on the ground but for the complainant moving aside it would have been dropped on his head however since he had raised his hands to protect himself the stone fell on his right little finger and also left forehand as a result of which he had sustained injuries ,FAC
df8cbab5bfef48f4874600b12c0ca430,3677,3879,At that point of time it is stated that Kumaranna Marulappa Jagadeesha and Rajanna had come to his rescue and it is on seeing these people that the accused had fled in the car in which they had come ,FAC
9df25352caf64377835688eac40b1e93,3880,4248,The complainant was shifted to Arasikere hospital for treatment and thereafter a statement was recorded by the Station House Officer on 23 2 2005 at about 11 30 a m and thereafter further proceedings were taken accused were arrested chargesheeted and later charges were also framed against the accused to which they have pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried ,FAC
f7aa5b522ed94729b4a1e818dd3d4fc8,4249,4395,The Court below after having heard both the parties and after complying with other proceedings framed the following points for consideration 1 ,ISSUE
a0e6b88fce2f40ae947957b6e1e40466,4396,4814, Whether the prosecution proves that on 23 2 2005 at about 10 30 p m near Nagasamudra Shikharanya High School situated at B H Road of Bendekere Village the accused persons had formed themselves into an unlawful assembly in order to commit the offences in prosecution of common object of such unlawful assembly and thereby committed the offence punishable under Section 143 read with Section 149 of Indian Penal Code ,ISSUE
1e243459eace41d29620c3accaa84775,4816,5122,2 Whether the prosecution proves that on the above said date time and place in prosecution of common object of unlawful assembly the accused persons have committed rioting armed with deadly weapons and thereby committed the offence punishable under Section 148 read with Section 149 of Indian Penal Code ,ISSUE
f0e21b06080f4359a5c5145239fdf607,5126,5469,3 Whether the prosecution proves that on the above said date time and place in prosecution of common object of unlawful assembly have wrongfully restrained Chidananda from proceeding in the direction in which he has a right to proceed and thereby committed the offence punishable under Section 341 read with Section 149 at Indian Penal Code ,ISSUE
a6c1ef81563042bcb4849351359d9f5b,5469,5756, 4 Whether the prosecution proves on the above said date time and place in prosecution of common object of unlawful assembly have attempted to commit the murder of Chidananda and thereby committed the offence punishable under Section 307 read with Section 149 of Indian Penal Code ,ISSUE
cf7e99997b974f61be279323d051eedd,5756,6400, 5 The Court below held point Nos 1 to 3 in the affirmative and point No 4 in the negative and convicted the accused to undergo simple imprisonment for three months and to pay a fine of 100 for the offence punishable under Section 143 of IPC to undergo rigorous imprisonment for three months and to pay a fine of 500 for the offence punishable under Section 148 of IPC to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months and to pay a fine of 500 for the offence punishable under Section 341 of IPC and to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years and to pay a fine of 1 000 for the offence punishable under Section 326 of IPC ,RLC
ad4679b574b44889996fa548527eda43,6401,6459,It is this which is under challenge in the present appeal ,RLC
4215b2fb15724db9807264a1f0e59d54,6459,6697, 6 The learned counsel for the appellants would first of all draw attention to the sequence of events as narrated to demonstrate that the exaggerated version of the prosecution is not forthcoming from a bare reading of the allegations ,ARG_PETITIONER
5be8b26936894f31a3051afeb83c279a,6698,6828,It is alleged that there were 8 accused most of whom were armed with deadly weapons that the victim was assaulted with the same ,ARG_PETITIONER
2ad03ed1c80842dfad172a2036fa46d4,6829,7036,Given the description of the weapons and the same which were produced as material objects it is difficult to accept that the injuries caused were only in the nature of abrasions which were minor in nature ,ARG_PETITIONER
382ff0af2bb84381af9b94bdc125832a,7037,7380,Except that an injury defined as a fracture is vaguely mentioned in the wound certificate there is no material evidence placed on record to indicate that the victim had suffered any kind of fracture and there is also no material placed on record to indicate that the victim was an inpatient and had undergone treatment for any serious injury ,ARG_PETITIONER
de199a66b8604c6384c29911e988722a,7381,7481,Though there is a claim that he was an inpatient no material evidence is produced before the Court ,ARG_PETITIONER
516108aaf1fb477b90ea177dc934fc89,7482,7739,On the other hand there is evidence on record to indicate that the victim had exercised his franchise at the elections held in the village two days after the incident which was against the statement that he was an inpatient for a week after the incident ,ARG_PETITIONER
7cba6a090b4d4b0aa5f693c29c1d849d,7740,8996,In this regard though the learned counsel for the appellants would take this Court through the further details of the alleged incident as claimed by the prosecution to demonstrate that it was impossible for a large number of 8 people to have simultaneously attacked the victim and to only cause minor injuries when most were armed with deadly weapons and therefore would submit that there is a background which is not also in dispute of the victim having established a fair price depot and accused No 1 also having established a fair price depot and there being unhealthy competition between them and a case and counter case being filed for the irregularities in the fair price depot which lead to enemity between the two and further there being also political rivalry it was just to foist a false case against the appellants in order to prevent their participation in the elections that the entire case has been engineered and therefore he would submit that the injuries which are described in the wound certificate are from a mere fall from a vehicle which has been used to the advantage of the victim in claiming that there was a criminal assault as a result of which he has suffered the injuries and therefore there is no substance in the same ,ARG_PETITIONER
e78c962aa3cb4e6f9b325d9044a8deb0,8996,9129, 7 The learned counsel would also point out that the entire findings of the Trial Court are based on the evidence tendered by PW 6 ,ARG_PETITIONER
f89afa60d2e943c1900abe8eedb7237a,9130,9769,PW 6 in his evidence has narrated that he was in his house when he heard the collusion and he had come out of the house at which time the other witnesses namely PWs 2 and 4 who had also joined him and had witnessed the actual commission of the offence but the learned counsel would point out that if going by the sequence of events as claimed by the prosecution if it is to be believed that PW 6 first heard the maruti van crashing into the motorcycle and on hearing the collision if he had come out the assault by the accused if at all had occurred would have been completed by the time he positioned himself to witness the scene ,ARG_PETITIONER
3decb5d537024957807ec5df7e0172a3,9769,9904, But he had claimed that each of the witnesses had been in a position to record as to the overt acts committed by each of the accused ,ARG_PETITIONER
5e101aa3d930497887172d5b5b908310,9905,10089,This is difficult to accept especially in the light of the circumstance that PWs 2 and 4 who also claimed to be witness to the incident had not supported the case of the prosecution ,ARG_PETITIONER
98a1f974a44a46f28416728bc41216d7,10089,10326, Therefore the entire prosecution case in so far as the allegation of the complainant being sought to be supported by the evidence of PW 6 cannot be accepted as enabling the prosecution to establish the case beyond all reasonable doubt ,ARG_PETITIONER
21f4a7029bcd41178eb7a01faa33fd64,10327,10778,In the absence of cogent medical evidence to support the so called serious injuries suffered by the victim and in the absence of cogent evidence in support of the case of the prosecution except that of PW 6 and the self serving evidence of the plaintiff the prosecution has not established its case as found by the Trial Court and therefore would submit that the conviction has lead to a miscarriage of justice and seeks intervention of the Court ,ARG_PETITIONER
65d2ea80f2a945d7a0fb14bf88679b12,10779,10875,While the learned State Public Prosecutor would seek to justify the judgment of the Trial Court ,ARG_PETITIONER
3f322e8548864a93a61b2f84d1aba793,10877,11290,8 In the light of the above rival contentions and from the material on record as rightly contended by the learned counsel for the appellants if the case of the prosecution is to be accepted and the accused having employed deadly weapons to attack the victim and if indeed he had been assaulted in the manner as claimed the injuries suffered by the complainant would not have been restricted to mere abrasions ,ANALYSIS
100a5329bd8847c6b367daaaadd4a0fe,11291,11480,Though there is mention of a fracture which is only vaguely indicated in the wound certificate there is no other material evidence as regard to the victim having suffered serious fracture ,ANALYSIS
d2b1151708fc474d911352df76fe0895,11481,11664,There is also no material evidence of the victim having undergone treatment as an inpatient though the claim made by him in the course of evidence it is unchallenged by the accused ,ANALYSIS
cd491335a5274f2dbe61db97fabc956f,11665,12241,Secondly the sequence of events as projected by the prosecution on the basis of the complainant s statement and which is sought to be supported by PW 6 does not also evoke the confidence of this Court for the manner in which the incident is stated to have occurred to be seconded by the statement of PW 6 is difficult to accept since the incident if it had indeed taken place would have occurred at a pace so swift that it would be difficult for an eye witness to record the overt acts of each of the 8 accused persons and to state the same with any degree of certainty ,ANALYSIS
bef4eada9b93446ab8e0f45240d3577b,12242,12463,Therefore it is difficult to accept that the moment the vehicle on which the victim was travelling was intercepted PW 6 having run out of his house and having been in a position to witness the incident as it unravelled ,RATIO
ba90ed4cc11b4fcabbabf71ef2925cc6,12464,12734,Therefore it is evident that PW 6 has been cited as a witness only to lend lip support to the case of the prosecution and going by the background that there was political enemity between the two groups it is an apparent attempt to make out a case against the accused ,RATIO
34f36351a4c04c54b0e11c8dad92c111,12735,12914,Therefore given the sequence of events and the material on record this Court does not find that the Trial Court was justified in convicting the accused for the offences alleged ,RATIO
68d85cf9a1e142cfae6509ecbc6dcf9b,12914,12951, Accordingly the appeal is allowed ,RPC
fdcbd0c5ab0949cea0e2e8f44a178adf,12952,12993,Judgment of the Court below is set aside ,RPC
988b94d0b177421186a1ae1fe4ede74b,12994,13023,The appellants are acquitted ,RPC

47401b527c97423a97f7e6e42fa6cf6a,365,1709,On an earlier occasion after hearing the petitioner who appeared in person and the learned counsel for the respondent we had passed order dated September 4 2017 thereby disposing of this petition with the following directions a insofar as domestic violence proceedings before the Family Court are concerned necessary documents shall be filed by both the parties within four weeks from today and evidence led pursuant thereto The trial court shall endeavour to decide the case finally within a period of eight months from today on the basis of evidence and fix the rate of maintenance finally and b Crl MC No 850 of 2015 pending before the High Court shall be taken up for hearing immediately and the High Court shall endeavour to dispose of the same as expeditiously as possible and determine at what rate interim maintenance is to be given i e whether order dated February 13 2015 passed by the learned ASJ need any modification or not 2 Thereafter review petition was filed by the petitioner pointing out that there was apparent error in passing the aforesaid directions inasmuch as matter was remitted to the High Court for presumption that proceedings were pending but the fact is that no such proceedings are pending under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005 for short the DV Act ,FAC
11c8292c1c9e4c93b5ee4c0a32f7bee5,1709,1835,Realising this error the review petition was allowed and the Special Leave Petition was restored which has been heard afresh ,FAC
d46a43a90eda484aa122f3bd3893b4e8,1835,2014, 3 Notwithstanding the aforesaid factual error which had crept in the order dated September 4 2017 the other factual details recorded in the said order are a matter of record ,FAC
98d4656b4d5c42e1af9c730b4746d797,2015,2308,Therefore it would be in the fitness of things to reproduce the same Though this case has a chequered history only those facts which are very material are taken note of eschewing other unnecessary details in order to avoid burdening this judgment with the facts which may not be relevant ,FAC
c46db8f7195f45caa83ba537a6aac40f,2308,2350, The petitioner is the respondent s wife ,FAC
716e9b2f239740c6b9380c6dbad43af7,2351,2467,It is unfortunate that after their marriage on April 20 2007 in Delhi they stayed together hardly for four months ,FAC

919d35fb0e674a7dbbe9ff4935fe5305,3699,3943,However when it was held that lottery tickets are not goods the sales tax imposed on lottery tickets was withdrawn by the State Government and the Maharashtra Tax on Lotteries Act 2006 hereinafter referred to as the State Act was enacted ,FAC
751f4b2d248846e488503321a32b7de5,3943,4277, 3 It is the contention of the petitioners that the legislature of State of Maharashtra has no legislative power to enact Laws relating to State Lotteries including Laws relating to taxation and therefore according to the petitioners the State Act is beyond the legislative competence of the legislature of State of Maharashtra ,ARG_PETITIONER
c6df8f2ddc8f48459946e7ff6fd552a9,4278,4454,The second submission is that the enactment of the State Act is colourable exercise of the legislative power inasmuch as it is another method of levying tax on lottery tickets ,ARG_PETITIONER
362cccb3c8ad416096fb849951d8db5d,4455,4662,The third submission is that the State Act seeks to levy tax on lottery schemes tax is collected in advance in respect of each draw in the lottery scheme at the rate specified in Section 3 of the State Act ,ARG_PETITIONER
b4d016bd09da465dbbfe65fab28e6135,4663,4895,It is submitted that lottery scheme of all other State organizing and conducting lotteries save and except that of Maharashtra are formulated outside the State of Maharashtra and therefore the Law has extra territorial application ,ARG_PETITIONER
fcfd658e7c27433899d4da632ed67850,4896,5112,The fourth submission is that the State Act levies tax on lottery schemes but the term lottery scheme is not defined anywhere and therefore it is violative of guarantee under Article 14 of the Constitution of India ,ARG_PETITIONER
5d0fe6971e6949829f89caf6da1a24aa,5113,5454,It was also contended that the State Act has been enacted to impose tax on sale of lottery tickets conducted by other States in State of Maharashtra so as to make selling of lottery tickets by the other States uneconomical unviable and thereby creating monopoly in the lottery tickets of the lotteries conducted by the State of Maharashtra ,ARG_PETITIONER
874c9c323e834be1bc26fa2cca78f49f,5454,5651, 4 Elaborating the first submission the learned Counsel appearing for petitioners submitted that the legislature of State of Maharashtra has no legislative competence to enact the impugned Act ,ARG_PETITIONER
e7a884c2f5c04569b38eeba0be231d20,5652,5724, By the impugned Act tax is sought to be levied on the lottery schemes ,ARG_PETITIONER
9884f00e9fbd4a1abba01c9702fc504d,5725,6084,The subject Lotteries organised by the Government of India or the Government of a State comes in Entry 40 of List I in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India and therefore only Parliament is empowered to enact Law relating to lotteries governed by Government of India or the Government of a State or any law relating to such tax on the lotteries ,ARG_PETITIONER
e6d357d0fe1b4d8f85746dc5fc14671e,6085,6261,It is submitted that the State legislature does not have competence to levy tax on the lotteries under Entry 62 of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India ,ARG_PETITIONER
ece0393a5f854c08ae1800046931858a,6262,6874,The learned Counsel relied on the judgments of the Supreme Court in the cases H Anraj others Vs State of Maharashtra AIR 1984 2 Supreme Court 781 and H Anraj others Vs Government of Tamilnadu AIR 1986 Supreme Court 63 and it was submitted that the lotteries organized by the State are necessarily excluded from betting and gambling mentioned in Entry 62 of List II of the Seventh schedule and then it was contended that the State of Maharashtra has not shown any other source of power except Entry 62 of List II of the Seventh Schedule and therefore the State Act is beyond its legislative competence ,ARG_PETITIONER
5deaeb3166ef4c65af5285fbde4e6e30,6874,7214, 5 Elaborating the second submission it was submitted that prior to the decision of the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in the case M s Sunrise Associates Vs Govt of NCT of Delhi Ors AIR 2006 Supreme Court 1908 the State of Maharashtra has been collecting tax on State lottery tickets treating lottery tickets as goods ,ARG_PETITIONER
b43403ae813144039d087ac8bf7dc0d9,7215,7412,However once it was held to be unconstitutional as lottery tickets were held not to be the goods now again tax is being collected on sale of lottery tickets under the provisions of the State Act ,ARG_PETITIONER
b05c0b218795443f9300a4632c29d1e8,7412,7537, 6 Elaborating the third submission it was contended that the State Act seeks to levy and collect tax on lottery schemes ,ARG_PETITIONER
ce1b3ceb95da4ee7bc4c4075f6df6b59,7538,7981,It was submitted that the lottery schemes of other States organizing and conducting lotteries save and except that of State of Maharashtra are formulated outside State of Maharashtra and in the respective State organizing and conducting lotteries and the draws in respect of the said schemes are also held in the said States itself and the results are also declared in the said States and published in the official Gazettes of the said States ,ARG_PETITIONER
c26426cb0e3c46f993d2d12471af0e0b,7982,8219,Thus by seeking to charge and collect tax on lottery schemes the State Act seeks to tax events which have occurred outside the State and hence the State Act is dealing with the subject which is not within its territorial jurisdiction ,ARG_PETITIONER
e068a320ca7343e3aa5d404f49ed581d,8219,8374, 7 Elaborating the fourth submission it was contended that though tax is imposed in relation to the schemes the term Scheme is not defined in the Act ,ARG_PETITIONER
f81b3a79c20d460f9636ab1377dfa3a7,8375,8567,Thus the tax is being levied with reference to the concept which is extremely vague and therefore levying of tax in such a situation violates the guarantee of Article 14 of the Constitution ,ARG_PETITIONER
aae10d9aabd648b3a51d2535aea8ea89,8568,8894,It was also submitted that extremely large amount has been collected as tax under the Act with a view to make it uneconomical to sell tickets of lotteries conducted by other States in the State of Maharashtra with a view to create monopoly in relation to the lottery tickets of the lotteries conducted by State of Maharashtra ,ARG_PETITIONER
65a02014da9044d88cad56d6fd725c04,8894,8979, Thus according to the petitioners it is colourable exercise of legislative power ,ARG_PETITIONER

e2486a75696d4f74840aaea2275eb714,2478,2544, The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI J ,NONE
45b58e24b563408991a7cedad849e155,2545,2798,The appellant and one Mohd Yusuf Gulam Mohd were charged for an offence under s 379 read with s 34 of the Indian Penal Code for snatching two sarees from one Govind whilst he was carrying them from the show of his master to that of a washer and dyer ,FAC
534d474acc3f48ee99256097dc336398,2799,3065,The learned Presidency Magistrate who tried the case accepted the prosecution evidence and found the appellant and Mohd Yusuf Gulam Mohd guilty of the offence under s 379 read with s 34 andSentenced each of their to suffer rigorous imprisonment for six months ,RLC
bf592d6d8a614241a0e3fc45bc78c235,3066,3301,It does not appear from the judgment of the learned Presidency Magistrate that though the appellant was only seventeen years and three months old at the date of the offence and the offence was not punishable with imprisonment for life,FAC
a9cae76f9c21453d9b8b09b8b644d4cc,3301,3432, the attention of the learned presidency Magistrate was invited to the provisions of s 6 of the Probation of offenders Act 1958 ,FAC
0e475f6ad6444407ad44d7820edaafc6,3433,3574,The appellant preferred an appeal against the order of conviction and sentence to the High Court of p Bombay but the appeal was unsuccessful ,FAC
974952a5a4ea4ddbbe2f375e192d0ef2,3575,3737,The High Court took the same view of the evidence as the learned Presidency Magistrate and confirmed the conviction of the appellant under s 379 read with s 34 ,RLC
fb7e4dd116d744d2a8dc09d70ad56baf,3738,3974,So far as the question of sentence was concerned a submission was made on behalf of the appellant that since he was a young boy of about seventeen years and three months and this was his first offence leniency should be shown tow him ,FAC
263992b726b542438bbf3e0475fef6e1,3975,4294,But the High Court r observed that age alone was not sufficient to invoke the mercy of the Court and the appellant had not done anything since the date of the offence to deserve the mercy of the Court and it did not therefore see any reason to interfere with the sentence of imprisonment passed against the appellant ,RLC
1b95e4d8e6284e8ba71e248f63692335,4295,4559,It appears that once again the provisions of s 6 of the Probation of offenders Act 1958 were not specifically brought to the notice of the High Court and the sentence of imprisonment was maintained by the High Court without applying its mind to those provisions ,FAC
5e7c5015905e4935bbaa55aca5d66a27,4560,4808,Hence the appellant preferred a petition for special leave to this Court and on that petition this Court granted special leave limited to the question whether the provisions of the Probation of offenders Act should have been applied in the case ,FAC
4c02847d94c94fa8b3b6f08cd4a6889e,4818,5012,We are concerned in this appeal with s 6 of the Probation of offenders Act 1958 for it is only under that section that the appellant claims the benefit of the provisions contained in the Act ,ANALYSIS
84373953c69f46908e5a9074ec6b7056,5013,5562,Subsection 1 of s 6 on a plain grammatical reading of its language provides that when any person under twenty one years age is found guilty of having committed an offence punishable with imprisonment but not with imprisonment for life the Court by which the person is found guilty shall not impose any sentence of imprisonment unless it is satisfied that having regard to the circumstances of the case including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender it would not be desirable to deal with himhim under s 3 or s 4 ,STA
15c045ecf096484597655fc95c8eb369,5563,5797,This inhibition on the power of the Court to impose a sentence of imprisonment applies not only at the state of trial court but also at the stage High court or any other Court when the case comes before it on appeal or in revision ,ANALYSIS
5f69b7e3e09a4256a2465781380d6243,5798,5832,Vide s 11 sub s 1 of the Act ,ANALYSIS
25d0cfc94b734d52b9b1d5ae3656762f,5832,6426, It is therefore obvious that even though the point relating to the applicability of s 6 was not raised before the learned Presidency Magistrate or the High Court this Court is bound to take notice of the provisions of that section and give its benefit to the appellant particularly since it is a section which is intended for the benefit of juvenile delinquents reflecting the anxiety of the Legislature to protect them from contact or association with hardened criminals in jails and retrieve them from a life of crime and rehabilitate them as responsible and useful members of society ,ANALYSIS
d7e29160ce834d08b3b62deb64394958,6426,6722, Here we find that whatever date be taken as the relevant date for determining the applicability of s 6 whether the date of the offence or the date of the judgment of the learned Presidency Magistrate or the date of the judgment of the High Court the appellant was below twenty one years age ,ANALYSIS
f05cf17ba95244e3895005739c8007dc,6723,6899,The offence of which he is found guilty is an offence under s 379 read with s 34 and it is clearly an offence punishable with imprisonment but not with imprisonment for life ,ANALYSIS
4364741fce534ee79f4394e0b12ca53a,6900,7324,The conditions requisite for the applicability of s 6 are therefore plainly satisfied and under s 6 Sub s 1 it is not competent to the Court to impose ant sentence of imprisonment on the appellant unless the Court is satisfied that having regard to the circumstances of the case including the nature of the offence and the character of the appellant it would not be desirable to deal with him under s 3 or s 4 ,ANALYSIS
50589931d9f5407d950c62ae7b7e10d1,7325,7864,It is true that sub s 2 of s 6 requires that for the purpose of satisfying itself whether it would not be desirable to deal with the appellant under s 3 or s 4 the Court is required to call for a report from the Probation officer and consider the report if any but we do not think it necessary in the present case to call for any report from the Probation officer nor to remand the case to the learned Presidency Magistrate for passing an appropriate order after calling for a report from the Probation officer and considering it ,ANALYSIS
a69be736d701498891b4341393aa3e6d,7864,7945, We have on record the antecedent history giving the background of the appellant ,ANALYSIS
16073aafd15c494397ee13d5aa954b55,7946,8061,The appellant was at one time a well known child film actor and he actually won several awards for acting in films ,ANALYSIS
ec44cb2b680146b58ddc5b057b2fd668,8062,8147,It appears that at some subsequent stage he fell in bad company and took to evil ways,ANALYSIS
ef4ed4396ab94fb782d0a2079893079b,8148,8411,The offence which he is convicted is no doubt an offence as theft which cannot be lightly ignored but it is comparatively of a minor characters in that only two sarees were snatched away from the hands of Govind perhaps under the stress of economic necessity ,RATIO
ca3682e2e4a6463285e43898c34e76f6,8412,8463,Moreover this is a false offence of the appellant ,RATIO
1db2d3cead184c6bb3063de172a646d1,8464,8685,We are therefore not at all satisfied 12 L925SupCI 75that it would not be desirable to deal with the appellant under s 3 or s 4 and consequently the sentence of imprisonment passed on the appellant must be set aside ,RATIO
8e3db96e1308428e92cab0ee724ca74c,8685,9061, We accordingly set aside the sentence of imprisonment passed on the appellant and direct that he be released on his entering into a bond wit one surety in the sum of Rs 500 to appear in the Court of the Presidency Magistrate to receive sentence whenever called upon to do so within a period of six months and during that period to keep the peace and be of good behaviour ,RPC
c9ebb9fe0c6d44199322a147fbd02bf2,9062,9218,The learned Presidency Magistrate is directed to take the necessary bond from the appellant and the necessary surety bond from a surety to his satisfaction ,RPC
3864aae5896d4ccba11ec13154d15b09,9219,9353,The appellant will continue on bail till such time as these directions are carried out after which the bail bond will stand canceled ,RPC

2fa7b9108a0e48f898df1c3ba8b3c2a8,4953,5517,The High Court called for a supplementary statement of the case and pursuant thereto the Tribunal submitted a statement on the specified points raised by the order of the High Court that 1 The firm which carried on the business during the calendar year 1947 was dissolved on July 7 1951 when Butto Kristo Roy one of the partners died 2 During the previous year 1947 there was no instrument of partnership in existence but the terms of the oral partnership were the same as set out in the partnership deed dated October 17 1949 3 ,FAC

5bec64107240471ab50bcda09ec4b9e1,6491,6715, The Tribunal and the High Court approached the problem before them on the assumption that the source of the power of the Income tax Officer to impose a penalty was in section 44 of the Indian Income tax Act 1922 ,ANALYSIS
fb066eca52604120b3ad09665e15097e,6716,6768,In so assuming in our judgment they were in error ,ANALYSIS
eb6d9c77509b4bfcac99399711e3d7b6,6769,7307,Section 44 of the Indian Income tax Act 1922 as it stood at the relevant date in so far as it is material provided Where any business profession or vocation carried on by a firm has been discontinued every person who was at the time of such discontinuance a partner of such firm shall in respect of the income profits and gains of the firm be jointly and severally liable to assessment under Chapter IV and for the amount of tax payable and all the provisions of Chapter IV shall so far as may be apply to any such assessment ,STA
ab4cf4bf97f94935ae2595a342094a46,7307,7488, The section is fairly plain it applies to cases of discontinuance of the business of a firm and not where there is dissolution of the firm but not discontinuance of its business ,ANALYSIS
db1e43d17c954077b5ad95a1b0fbbed0,7488,8001, In S M S Karuppiah Pillai v Commissioner of Income tax Madras 1 in dealing with the effect of s 44 of the Indian Income tax Act 1922 before it was amended by Act 7 of 1939 a Full Bench of the Madras High Court observed This section s 44 only applies when there has been discontinuance of the business The section 1 911 T R I says that if a business is discontinued the partners shall nevertheless be jointly and severally liable for the profits which had been earned ,PRE_RELIED
00fae0d7ffe6497a9260d9ebfbcd8e93,8002,8277,In Shivram Poddar v Income tax Officer Central Circle II Calcutta and Anr 1 this Court examined the scheme of s 44 before it was amended by the Finance Act of 1958 and its inter relation with the provisions of ss 25 1 2 26 1 2 and 28 1 c in some detail ,PRE_RELIED
7a53632776914d159e080fdbe10c1093,8278,8497,The Court observed Section 44 operates in two classes of cases where there is discontinuance of business profession or vocation carried on by a firm or association and where there is dissolution of an association ,ANALYSIS
3e2d1dc219f142cd9ec379984d5fa58f,8498,8641,It follows that mere dissolution of a firm without discontinuance of the business will not attract the application of s 44 of the Act ,ANALYSIS
7c6f0af313894453af303e19c986e603,8641,8773,The reason for this distinction appears from the scheme of the Income tax Act in its relation to assessment of the income of a firm ,ANALYSIS
ccdd5d4015454336a3753328b5313aa8,8774,8991,A firm whether registered or unregistered is recognised under the Act as a unit of assessment sections 3 and 2 2 and its income is computed under clauses 3 and 4 of section 23 as the income of any other unit ,ANALYSIS
01d35b4c73b1414d8bf8473a539058c0,8992,9142,Section 25 1 relates to assessment in cases of a discontinued business whether the business is carried on by a firm or by any other person ,STA
9ff78aa060f34305b1467f0662aa43dc,9143,9366,Then there is the special provision relating to assessment when at the time of making an assessment it is found that a change has occurred in the constitution of a firm or a firm has been newly constituted section 26 1 ,STA
0cadae339bd941fb880ad41df054e72d,9367,9859,The date on which the change has occurred is immaterial it may be in the year of account in the year of assessment or even after the close of the year of assessment The Income fax Officer has under section 26 1 to assess the firm as constituted at the time of making the assessment but the income profits and gains of the previous year have for the purpose of inclusion in the total income of the partners to be apportioned between the partners who were entitled to receive the same ,ANALYSIS
e3b966db607342fdb8c674750ab4993a,9860,10052,Subsection 2 of section 26 relates to assessment in the case of succession to a person which expression includes a firm carrying on a business by another person in such capacity ,ANALYSIS
2bdf8d9c61ea43f98b35c73bf07f7cb1,10053,10267,Discontinuance of business has the same connotation in section 44 as if has in section 25 of the Act it does not 1 51 T T R 823 cover mere change in ownership or in the constitution of the unit of assessment ,ANALYSIS

d0af6f5529b7484fa4bd7b903515f9f8,5410,5481,It is that which is under challenged in the present Revision Petition ,FAC
101e938d4be142469d68ea8108074a4d,5483,5736,4 The learned counsel for the petitioners would point out that having regard to the facts and circumstances the Courts below have committed an error in holding that the charges against the petitioners have been established beyond all reasonable doubt ,ARG_PETITIONER
4e5c30d423d5486993c13258dca0dab6,5737,5825,There was a delay in lodging the complaint which has not been taken into consideration ,ARG_PETITIONER
5ca601ff9b3d4f8683ce4c83c65c932e,5826,5889,No reasonable explanation has been given by PW1 in this regard ,ARG_PETITIONER
7d35265304ec4ff3ad33dd5b21f24f9e,5890,6304,It is not in dispute that PW1 and PW2 are brothers and therefore the evidence of PW1 was that of an interested witness and it is also an admitted circumstance that though it was stated that there was standing enmity between the petitioners and PW2 and his family the prosecution had not made any attempt to prove such enmity or that it was a motive for the alleged commissioning of the offence by the petitioners ,ARG_PETITIONER
762732a71e344179b2bb2e2fc1843ba5,6305,6467,There is also a glaring circumstance that PW1 in his cross examination has admitted that after the alleged incident PW2 was taken to the hospital at 10 30 p m ,ARG_PETITIONER
9ec018e6997c421c9ea6b28d10a9cea5,6468,6604,However PW7 the medical practitioner who is said to have attended on PW2 had indicated that he had administered treatment at 7 35 p m ,ARG_PETITIONER
244c3b494fa240b5b4fe1ab23bd1949d,6605,6810,This is a glaring contradiction would which indicate that the true facts were not before the Court and therefore Exhibit P4 the wound certificate was clearly a manipulation to implicate the petitioners ,ARG_PETITIONER
247545f782f24302b7bfaeb72c07d068,6811,7085,Further PW2 who was said to be the injured victim had stated that he had not made any statement before the concerned police and he had also stated that PWs 1 and 4 were about 50 feet away from the incident but there were contradictory statements of the other witnesses ,ARG_PETITIONER
3857aed535a2407d97aa096fb0bb781c,7086,7175,This has not been sought to be explained and the Courts below have glossed over the same ,ARG_PETITIONER
03ad9a1c4b444e3f9ea72c2318690687,7176,7376,It is further contended that PW4 was an alleged eye witness who had turned hostile and he had also admitted that MOs 1 and 2 were left behind at the spot and he had handed over the same to the police ,ARG_PETITIONER
16616e182e694d07a1ecd30c659cf33b,7377,7592,However PW5 the investigating officer had stated that there was a voluntary statement by accused No 1 petitioner No 1 herein and that it is pursuant to his statement that the said MOs 1 and 2 had been recovered ,ARG_PETITIONER
f8756b51d42245e5a799a6aba516c900,7593,7827,It is also stated that there were no blood stains on the said weapons and it is inexplicable that it was alleged as a result of the assault with the club by accused No 2 there was a bleeding cut injury which is totally inexplicable ,ARG_PETITIONER
7e1e7d95e2e944b1a3b030a17e496af8,7828,8026,Whereas the evidence of the medical practitioner was to the effect that injury caused by the club had resulted in a contusion and therefore these infirmities have not been sufficiently explained ,ARG_PETITIONER
52bc7f2eb5da419dac7fc23bf1047125,8027,8335,While more importantly the learned counsel for the petitioners would point out that insofar as the allegation that the petitioners were guilty of committing an offence punishable under Section 326 IPC require that the alleged injury caused was required to be of a grievous nature to invoke Section 326 IPC ,ARG_PETITIONER
8395fda2281443b2a0052db72be9835e,8336,8588,Having regard to the nature of the injuries as described under Exhibit P4 the injuries are of a minor nature and the mere statement by the medical practitioner that they are of a grievous nature would not bring it within the scope of Section 326 IPC ,ARG_PETITIONER
4de2061e67634d6c9ee38d114d6ce85d,8589,8738,It is further stated that insofar as the petitioners 3 and 4 at the trial are concerned there is no material to link them with the alleged incident ,ARG_PETITIONER
40317afbe69942738722d13dfd429bd4,8739,8818,The allegations against them are that they assaulted PW2 with their bare hands ,ARG_PETITIONER
ba1c3a24d21b46468e986befbe6e6e32,8819,9341,The medical practitioner had not indicated any such injuries which could have been caused by such assault and in the absence of any evidence in that regard it could not be said that any case was made out against the petitioners 3 and 4 and there is also no evidence to indicate that they had any truck with the petitioners 1 and 2 and hence the allegation of there being a common intention of the petitioner and of petitioners 3 and 4 being involved is a make believe allegation merely to implicate the said petitioners ,ARG_PETITIONER
cf32b0a3f14448b19acf49520b705a9c,9342,9920,Therefore the learned counsel would submit that the entire case is stage managed only to implicate the petitioners and they ought to be acquitted or in the alternative he would submit that the punishment imposed being glaringly disproportionate to the alleged injuries said to have been caused to PW2 would have to be drastically modified for the reason that no offence is made out under Section 326 IPC and even if there were injuries caused and an offence under Section 324 IPC is made out and the punishment imposed is disproportionate and would have to be set at naught ,ARG_PETITIONER
baa27891999847eba19bd442775100e7,9920,10696, 5 The learned Government Pleader would seek to justify that the judgement of the Trial Court which has been affirmed in appeal and would submit that the findings are findings of fact which are characterised as being without any basis and this is an incorrect contention and the learned Government Pleader would seek to take this Court through the record to demonstrate that the so called inconsistencies which are sought to be thrown up by the learned Counsel for the petitioner are not in fact inconsistencies which would go to the root of the matter and may be ascribed to the time lapse between the date of incident and the date of the trial and hence it is inevitable that there are minor discrepancies which cannot be said to be fatal to the case of the prosecution ,ARG_RESPONDENT
8109e66670c7407090ec0ae6220e1b51,10697,11282,The fact remains that PW2 was injured and the injuries having been established and since the matter has been investigated independently by the jurisdictional police it cannot be said that the petitioners have been falsely implicated in a case in the face of injuries caused and the evidence of other independent witnesses on the basis of which the Courts below have imposed nominal punishment even though punishment of a higher degree could have been imposed in the eye of law having regard to the circumstances of the case and therefore would seek dismissal of the present petition ,ARG_RESPONDENT
59cfa68194ce46b9a7f53cc171508a98,11282,11699, 6 In the light of the rival contentions and from a close perusal of the record it may straight away be said that insofar as petitioners 3 and 4 are concerned the allegations that there was a common intention between them and petitioners 1 and 2 and they had together caused injuries to PW2 is not established insofar as the petitioners 3 and 4 are concerned in the absence of any material evidence against them ,ANALYSIS
5699d140d80a487e9111ecfc1422acbf,11700,11899,Insofar as petitioners 1 and 2 are concerned the injuries which PW2 has suffered cannot be self inflicted it is therefore not possible to accept the contention that no incident has occurred at all ,ANALYSIS
9893b38e309c44d5b140b9771b9e4703,11900,12153,The evidence of the several witnesses would establish and would be consistent with the allegations that the petitioner No 1 had caused injury to the left ear of PW2 with a sickle and that he was also injured on his left hand with a club by accused No 2 ,ANALYSIS
2ee80708931f466aa3b8ed9af503b055,12154,12300,The question then would be whether the offence committed by the said accused would be an offence punishable under Section 324 or Section 326 IPC ,ANALYSIS
aa26c8947b33499288d36fe78b506ab1,12301,12903,As rightly pointed out by the learned Counsel for the petitioners Section 320 IPC which describes Grievous hurt gives 8 possible kinds of hurt which may be characterised as grievous hurt the injuries caused to PW2 do not fall within any of those categories and from a description of the injuries they may be charaterised only as simple injuries which were not likely to cause the death of the victim in which event it could not be said that an offence punishable under Section 326 IPC had been committed by the petitioners 1 and 2 and at best it was an offence punishable under Section 324 IPC ,ANALYSIS
3b0116b42d3447aaa4da600c9dc5a903,12904,13066,Therefore the conviction of the petitioners for an offence punishable under Section 326 IPC is misplaced and is not supported by the material evidence on record ,ANALYSIS
035132b913d04f60835bc5607da6fb6c,13067,13196,Insofar as the punishment imposed under Section 324 IPC again may be on the higher side going by the nature of injuries caused ,ANALYSIS
bc21344944cc4665bbaa84e1b0f37cde,13197,13778,When it was quite possible that there was a scuffle in which the victim also may have retaliated in which event the punishment that could have been imposed especially in the light of the circumstance that there was running enmity between the petitioners and the victim even according to the prosecution the message that the petitioners 1 and 2 should conduct themselves in a more civil manner would be brought home if they are made to feel the hardship of having to pay hard earned money as fine rather than the petitioners being incarcerated to fuel their enmity even higher ,ANALYSIS
f6586792a7d84c0b9bda07ed3733cb82,13779,14155,Hence in the opinion of this Court while setting aside the punishment imposed under Section 326 IPC as also the punishment imposed under Section 323 IPC sentencing the accused to undergo simple imprisonment for three months and while modifying the punishment imposed under Section 324 IPC and reducing the same to payment of fine of Rs 5 000 ends of justice would be met ,RATIO
d244d66f05474b82a195124a093737c8,14155,14222, 7 Accordingly the judgements of the Courts below are set aside ,RPC
d21344749ee640a8a35cd7eaf9a56ff6,14223,14631,The punishment imposed on the accused for offences punishable under Section 323 and 324 of the Indian Penal Code is reduced to payment of fine of Rs 5 000 each shall be payable jointly and severally by the accused petitioners 1 and 2 and out of such fine to be paid by the accused a sum of Rs 9 000 shall be paid to PW2 as compensation in terms of Section 357 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 ,RPC
d91b176899234c8d8381645d3188fd46,14632,14718,The punishment imposed as against accused No 3 and 4 is set aside on all three counts ,RPC

c51b17be145e43fe9d993ce7294348ea,3767,4224,These questions were 1 Whether the instrument of partnership dated 27 3 1946 created a deed of partnership 2 If the answer to question No 1 is in the affirmative whether the fact that on 1 1 1946 there was no firm in existence would be fatal to the application for registration of the firm under Section 26A of the Indian Income tax Act or whether the firm could be registered with effect from 26 3 1946 if it is held that the firm was genuine ,ISSUE
33b3b3eacaa24a31acf59fb3a98cc084,4224,4296,Prior to January 1 1945 there was a firm called Dwarkadas Khetan Co ,FAC
a4a26f9be8234ffc820a00e630734bcc,4297,4457,On that date the firm ceased to exist because the other partners had previously withdrawn and it came to be the sole proprietary concern of Dwarkadas Khetan ,FAC
a8875cfd751d45449e4f2db6a81f9fee,4458,4555,On February 12 1946 Dwarkadas Khetan obtained the selling agency of Seksaria Cotton Mills Ltd ,FAC

515300a1eaec4b9cb05575779bf7a204,4906,5084, Though Kantilal Kasherdeo was a minor he was admitted as a full partner and not merely to the benefits of the partner ship as required by s 30 of the Indian Partnership Act ,FAC
0cbd1329754d42659c123364d102f81c,5084,5282, To the instrument of partnership Kantilal Kasherdeo was also a signatory though immediately after his signature there was the signature of one Kasherdeo Rungta the natural guardian of the minor ,FAC
de1a40f8050a4b40b220884c61dd245d,5283,5462,In the instrument Kantilal Kasherdeo was described as a full partner entitled not only to a share in the profits but also liable to bear all the losses including loss of capital ,FAC

c070670bf77f43bda89b5837c4ab6be6,6542,6677,Though the partnership came into existence on March 27 1946 the firm was stated to have started retrospectively from January 1 1946 ,FAC

55e8a03c16554f37a9597d1320eb9532,4061,4378,The firm concealed particulars of its income in submitting its returns and the Income tax Officer Virudhunagar in the course of assessment proceedings directed by order dated May 20 1954 payment of penalty of Rs 20 000 for the year 1947 48 Rs 10 000 for theyear 1949 50 and Rs 5 000 for the year 1950 51 ,FAC

e51716df959749dab69e833ab138942d,4957,5375,It was submitted by the petitioners that by agreement between the partners the firm stood dissolved on April 13 1951 and intimation in that behalf was given to the Income tax Officer and that in any event the firm stood dissolved on May 5 1953 when one of the partners died and the Income tax Officer could not in exercise of the power under s 28 1 make an order imposing penalty after dissolution of the firm ,FAC

667defc4656e4f27aeaa6abe4a515c38,5734,6043,This Court in a recent judgment C A Abraham v Income tax Officer Kottayam 1 held that the Income tax Officer had power under s 28 of the Income tax Act to impose penalty in the course of assessment of a firm even if the firm stood at the date of the order dissolved by the death of one of its partners ,PRE_RELIED
6f188a1b140743bf84a5e9ea1a35a354,6044,6678,In so holding this Court observed that s 44 of the Income tax Act sets up machinery for assessing tax liability of a firm which has discontinued its business and that the expression assessment in the different sections ofChapter IV of the Income tax Act was not used merely in the sense of computation of income and when s 44 declared that the partners or members of the firm shall be jointly and severally liable to assessment it referred to the liability to computation of income under s 23 as well as the application of the procedure for declaration and imposition of tax liability and the machinery for enforcement thereof ,PRE_RELIED
4b5afb44885341b19341084da23e8c4f,6678,6871, Counsel for the appellants however contended that C A Abraham s case was one of an unregistered firm and the principle of that case has no application where the firm is a registered firm ,ANALYSIS
dd9f61b10cc640f5bc5153a9b98117b7,6872,7142,But s 44 makes the provisions of Chapter IV so far as may be applicable to assessment when any business profession or vocation carried on by a firm has been discontinued the section declares liability of all discontinued firms and not merely of unregistered firms ,ANALYSIS
1238e810196c417c97e56de553c8529b,7143,7257,There is nothing in s 44 or the context in which it occur to indicate that it does not apply to registered firms ,ANALYSIS

5305a1ffc9b54f77b0416dc715c8f87c,7835,8025,This plea was not set up in the petition and there is no reference to it in the judgment of the High Court and even in the statement of the case filed in this Court there is no trace of it ,ANALYSIS

715c0f0defb044569039ed0600772cbb,8208,9548,Section 28 1 of the Act in so far as it is material to these appeals provides If the Income tax Officer x x x x x x in the course of any proceedings under this Act is satisfied that any person a has without reasonable cause failed to furnish the return of his total income which he was required to furnish by notice given under sub section 1 or sub section 2 of section 22 or section 34 or has without reasonable cause failed to furnish it within the time allowed and in the manner required by such notice or b has without reasonable cause failed to comply with a notice under subsection 4 of section 22 or sub section 2 of section 23 or c has concealed the particulars of his income or deliberately furnished inaccurate particulars of such income he or it may direct that such persons shall by way of penalty in the case referred to in clause a in addition to the amount of the income tax and super tax if any payable by him a sum not exceeding one and a half times that amount and in the cases referred to in clauses b and c in addition to any tax payable by him a sum not exceeding one and a half times the amount of the income tax and super tax if any which would have been avoided if the income as returned by such person had been accepted as the correct income ,STA
500a7e2d9fe545a5aca44f9e3655062c,9550,9669,The expression person is defined in s 2 a of the Act as including a Hindu undivided family and a local authority ,STA
fe079af239b04ee68cfabb72cc10d10f,9670,9900,That evidently is not an exhaustive definition and recourse is permissible to the General Clauses Act which says in s 3 42 that a person includes any company or association or body of individuals whether incorporated or not ,STA
4c0c05e4b9d3492bb06b5bbf77667d29,9901,10143,A firm is manifestly a body of individuals and would therefore fall within the definition of person and may be exposed to an order for payment of penalty in the circumstances set out in cls a b and c of s 28 of the Income tax Act ,STA
af03b6eb059b49f4b3458facf97af95c,10144,10347,That a firm registered or unregistered may be liable to pay penalty has been further clarified by proviso d which declares the quantum of penalty payable by firms registered as well as unregistered ,STA
bb6a8182e3e742bb9be0476d04f86684,10348,10794,Counsel for the appellant however contends that even if a firm be regarded as a person within the meaning of the operative part of s 28 and the proviso thereof because of an obvious defect in drafting no liability for payment of penalty can be imposed upon a registered firm and in support of that contention he relies upon the last clause of the 1st sub section which provides for imposition of penalty in addition to any tax payable by him ,ANALYSIS
c3beef46d7a046bdaac507b86e8ba7d9,10794,11104, Counsel submits that only the person liable to pay tax may if found guilty of wrongful conduct specified in cls a b and c be ordered to pay penalty and by the scheme adopted by the Legislature for imposing tax liability upon registered firms under s 23 5 tax is never payable by a registered firm ,ANALYSIS
cc50a2bc417d4470b58254143c61679d,11105,11587,Counsel says that when the Legislature by Act 40 of 1940 enacted cl d of the proviso only the quantum of penal liability of a registered firm was declared but the liability could not still be enforced because by the substantive provision it depended solely upon the existence of an enforceable obligation of the firm and so long as an obligation was not imposed upon the firm to pay tax by an adequate amendment of s 23 5 the liability though quantified was unenforceable ,ANALYSIS
ee4f45469b5e4358a0c9abd28f9bcfea,11588,12081,It is urged that there were two defects in s 28 1 as originally drafted 1 that the penalty could beimposed only upon a person who was liable to pay income tax or super tax and 2 that the penalty which may be imposed was a multiple of the income tax and super tax if any which would have been avoided if the income as returned by such person would have been accepted as the correct income and by the enactment of cl d to the proviso the second defect was removed but not first ,ANALYSIS
426e122e1a494485a61f85711838c987,12082,12212,In support of this argument counsel relied upon s 23 5 as it stood before it was amended by s 14 of the Finance Act of 1956 ,ANALYSIS
1f6c5f7598a54f60b893651955a9272b,12213,12661,The clause provided that where an assessee is a firm and the total income of the firm has been assessed under sub s 1 sub s 3 or sub s 4 as the case may be the sum payable by the firm shall not be determined but the total income of each partner of the firm including therein his share of its income profits or gains of the previous year shall be assessed and the sum payable by him on the basis of such assessment shall be determined ,ANALYSIS
da8e2c318f6f41c3b29e03712f1c6437,12662,13012,Under this scheme the income of the registered firm was to be computed but tax was not assessed on the total income of the registered firm the income was distributed according to the terms of the agreement amongst the partners of the registered firm and added to the separate income of the partners and tax was levied on the partners individually ,ANALYSIS
d6b0b47d825d4bd4810bc5104ab7fdaa,13013,13283,Relying upon this scheme of levying tax it was urged by counsel for the respondent that as the registered firm was not liable to pay tax it could not be rendered liable to pay penalty under s 28 1 c Section 28 as it was originally enacted was somewhat obscure ,ANALYSIS
2a78665f913b4572be3c7c902c1f5800,13284,13544,The penalty which could be imposed in cases referred to in cls b and c was to be a sum not exceeding one and a half times the amount of the tax which would have been avoided if the income as returned by such person had been accepted as the correct income ,ANALYSIS
5e43b6302fc94d25935c1b0d04391fbc,13545,13753,But the Legislature did not give any indication whether thepenalty was related to the tax avoided by the partners of the firm or by the firm on the footing that it was to be regarded as an unregistered firm ,ANALYSIS
a85212c4a82b44b8b62cf5099c3a6d42,13754,13917,By s 23 5 income tax not being made payable by the firm but by the individual partners of a registered firm the legislative intention was not clearly expressed ,STA
4a84e3dbf6744d5e842177394e94daed,13918,14409,The Legislature to rectify the defect fixed an artificial basis for computing the penalty payable by a registered firm it provided that in the cases referred to in cls b and c the amount of the income tax and super tax which would have been avoided if the income as returned had been accepted as the correct income shall be taken to be the difference between the amount of the tax which would have been payable by an unregistered firm on an income equal to the firm s total income ,ANALYSIS
845d7d5c8c2e4ebfaebb6e017315d514,14410,14521,But the provision relating to imposition of liability to pay penalty by registered firms was clearly expressed ,ANALYSIS
440f3defea47465c9b2f1c84b68487b1,14522,14715,The assumption that the expression any tax used in s 28 1 is intended to indicate that there must be come tax payable by the assessee before penalty could be imposed is wholly unwarranted ,ANALYSIS

32c308d271ef4c89be1e873c67c3a769,15853,16192,Chief Justice Chakravartti speaking for the Court observed even when construed by its own language the concluding paragraph of section 28 1 cannot be said to make it a condition precedent that a person must be liable to pay some income tax or it may be also super tax if he is to be made liable for a penalty ,PRE_RELIED
43efc2753a9c432985768ea4c6368b71,16193,16433,Clause b of the proviso to my mind emphasizes that meaning of the concluding paragraph of Section 28 1 and rests on an assumption that under that provision a person may be chargeable to penalty although he may not be chargeable to tax ,PRE_RELIED
ac16ed08190a4c409512b07e17aca1f9,16434,16721,The learned Chief Justice also observed it was not really necessary for clause d of the proviso to enact specifically that a registered firm would be liable to pay a penalty despite the fact that it could not be charged and was not in fact charged to income tax or super tax ,ANALYSIS
0dc2db03c3704a41b0bdb8862a4057e3,16722,16936,The whole argument of Dr Sen Gupta was that the concluding paragraph of Section 28 1 had left a gap which had been attempted to be filled up by clause d of the proviso but the attempt had not been successful ,ANALYSIS
9133db7623504149be0619c8bf6f0abb,16937,17213,In my view the gap which undoubtedly existed in the concluding paragraph of section 28 1 was only an absence of a provision regarding the quantum of the penalty that could be levied from a registered firm because the quantum depends upon the amount of income tax payable ,ANALYSIS
d4232d912fbb475bb3a218b863dd8d3a,17213,17287,In our view the learned Chief Justice was right is so enunciating the law ,ANALYSIS
64982caa26cc4c4da5c282bff5bbb2d0,17288,17705,Under s 23 5 of the Indian Income tax Act before it was amended in 1956 in the case of a registered firm the tax payable by the firm itself was not required to bedetermined but the total income of each partner of the firm including therein the share of its income profits and gains of the previous year was required to be assessed and the sum payable by him on the basis of such assessment was to be determined ,ANALYSIS
1f2585ed88864ad28342794d12ccbacb,17706,17774,But this was merely a method of collection of tax due from the firm ,ANALYSIS
7af23e3b1b844dad88aabf28fb29b62a,17774,17955, The penalty provisions under s 28 would therefore in the event of the default contemplated by cls a b or c be applicable in the course of assessment of a registered firm ,ANALYSIS
0ad5c385712144c8959eb7d5390335d2,17956,18270,If a registered firm is exposed to liability of paying penalty by committing any of the defaults contemplated by cls a b or c by virtue of s 44 notwithstanding the dissolution of the firm the assessment proceedings are liable to be continued against the registered firm as if it has not been dissolved ,ANALYSIS
1f1aca9962684d91a6df40530b337141,18272,18659,Counsel contended that in any event penalty for the assessment year 1949 50 could not be imposed upon the assessee firm because there was no evidence that the Income tax Officer was satisfied in the course of any assessment proceedings under the Income tax Act that the firm had concealed the particulars of its income or had deliberately furnished inaccurate particulars of the income ,ANALYSIS
389aeff0bfb640e9a75e6155a361b807,18660,18950,The power to impose penalty under s 28 depends upon the satisfaction of the Income tax Officer in the course of proceedings under the Act it cannot be exercised if he is not satisfied about the existence of conditions specified in cls a b or c before the proceedings are concluded ,ANALYSIS
e79660c56c1b40989ff2b3e3a2d55ecb,18951,19120,The proceeding to levy penalty has however not to be commenced by the Income Tax Officer before the completion of the assessment proceedings by the Income tax Officer ,ANALYSIS
f5b8cf00c0b44a7fabe637079592209d,19120,19314, Satisfaction before conclusion of the proceeding under the Act and not the issue of a notice of initiation of any step for imposing penalty is a condition for the exercise of the jurisdiction ,ANALYSIS
6e42b4d6dcf24dde932cbc4e8660a3cb,19314,19477, There is no evidence on the record that the Income tax Officerwas not satisfied in the course of the assessment proceeding that the firm had concealed its income ,RATIO
736ad4456b8b446a93f8a8f6dc071eb1,19477,19825, The assessment order is dated November 10 1951 and there is an endorsement at the foot of the assessment order by the Income tax Officer that action under s 28 had been taken for concealment of income indicating clearly that the Income tax Officer was satisfied in the course of the assessment proceeding that the firm had concealed its income ,RATIO
8697cd5a8f3b43fa9b13d78699b006ca,19825,20009, In our view the High Court was in error in holding that penalty could not be imposed under s 28 1 c upon the firm Messrs S V Veerappan Chettiar Co after its dissolution ,RATIO
